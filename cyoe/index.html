      The intense Summer heat of India was relentless as it bore down on you daily, the sun scorching your skin and
      shade
      was in little supply. The warm evening air still, offering no cooling breeze as you walked back through the town.
      It
      was your first time in the Country, it wouldn’t have been your first choice for a place to visit, but it was a
      business trip, not one for pleasure. With the company paying for all your expenses, the sweltering heat was a
      small
      price to pay in order to experience a culture vastly different from back home, and that price was at the cost of
      someone else.<br><br>

      With business finally taken care of you enjoyed the last few days you had before flying back home and returning to
      normal life. You sighed loudly and collapsed onto the bed once you returned to the hotel room. It was a rather
      spacious room for just one person. With some days still left you felt no need to pack your belongings just yet and
      instead shut your eyes and relaxed as your mind slowly drifted off for the night.<br><br>

      A white ceiling came into focus as the early morning sun beamed brightly into the room. With no other plans for
      the
      last few days of your trip you got up and commenced with your morning routine. A quick shower, followed by some
      breakfast and a drink courtesy of the hotel, you looked through your phone reading up on what was happening in the
      world while you slept.<br><br>

      Finished, and with a full day of possibilities, you walked out onto the small private balcony. Most of the town
      was
      quiet, with few people out in the marketplace getting ready to open their stalls. Just behind the marketplace lay
      the stunning view of the jungle. Exotic plants and tall grass lined the entrance before disappearing into the
      tightly packed trees, there were no nature paths or ways for cars to travel in or out it seemed, a terrain that
      would test a person's skill. With no other plans, and the full day still available to you.<br><br>

      What do you do?<br><br>Decide it would be an interesting place to explore for the day - <a class="choice"
        value="2">Continue</a><br><br>Suddenly hope a particular python resided in there - <a class="choice"
        value="3">Continue</a><br><br>

    </div>
    <div id="2" class="section">

      Taking a quick stop at the marketplace you find a single stall that finally opened, purchasing some water you chat
      with the local about the jungle. The man warns you that you stay within the town as no one who had ever ventured
      into the jungle had ever come back out.<br><br>

      Intrigued and filled with a sense of adventure, you thank the man for the water and for his concern, and make your
      way to the jungle, positive the man was over exaggerating, but curious what the jungle could possibly conceal, you
      make haste and exit the town with a spring in your step, looking forward to a trek through the jungles of India.
      As
      you took the short walk towards the dense treeline your head filled with possible things you may encounter.
      Beautiful views, rare plants, animals of all kinds, from the smallest of frogs to the largest of snakes, looking
      forward to boasting about it to your colleagues. Finally you stop at the vibrant leaves ahead, and look back at
      the
      town, the buildings much smaller than before, no longer able to see the merchant who warned you about entering.
      You
      take a deep breath and smile as you push forward.<br><br>

      Looking out at the luscious greenery your mind suddenly plays out a scene from the Jungle Book, an encounter you
      were drawn to ever since you were exposed to it as a kid. You dreamed of taking Mowglis place in those captivating
      coils, wishing nothing more than to feel his tail winding round your body, trapping you further and further with
      no
      chance of escape, before finally reaching your neck and constricting the life from you briefly, treating you like
      a
      pet squeeze toy. It's certainly your strongest desire, and your mind began to wonder if he could possibly exist.
      You
      shook your head and laughed it off as the thought appeared, a silly fantasy involving a fictional snake, that you
      dared tell no one about. However with nothing else planned for the day you decided to humour your thoughts, you
      elected to pack some supplies and head into the jungle in search of the giant rock python, at the very least it
      would be a nice trek.<br><br>

      As you walked towards the outskirts of the town a neary shopkeeper was preparing to open his business for the day,
      he greeted you, asking what your plans for the day were. You told him you fancied a wander through the jungle, the
      merchant warned that it'd be best to stay within the town as no one who had ever entered there had ever come back
      out. Your heart raced, hoping they all met the not so fictional creature, and he may currently be waiting in the
      trees for his next victim, a situation you secretly longed for.<br><br>

    <div id="4" class="section">

      Brushing through the tall grass you take your first steps into the dense overgrowth, leaving civilization further
      behind with each step you take. The intensity of the humid heat picks up as you venture more, birds sing as
      various
      other animals emit sounds of life. Despite lacking other humans, the jungle was full of various species all hidden
      by the immense foliage.<br><br>

      You traveled for a while, your life spent in the city surrounded by other people meant you never developed a
      strong
      sense of precaution. Especially when you were in a jungle, as you failed to pick up on the sounds of the wildlife
      slowly getting more quiet, until finally the only noise was made by you as you brushed past large leaves, and
      stepped on the large blades of grass.<br><br>

      Completely unaware that the silence meant that the animals avoided the area for a reason, and that reason existed
      high above as a lone creature had noticed your presence, it picked up a familiar scent a little while ago, one
      which
      belonged to animals he oh so much enjoyed entertaining, ones he had encountered many times before you.<br><br>

      The creature in question came in the form of a thick brown python with dark spots running down its immeasurable
      length, thought to be a fictional creature the sinister snake known as Kaa really existed, he slowly slithered
      down
      from the treetops towards you, his unsuspecting prey, for a better viewpoint.<br><br>

      He began drooling slightly as the scent was getting stronger, he laid in wait patiently until finally you pushed
      the
      leaves aside and the Indian python at last got a good glimpse of you. Kaa smacked his scaly lips “Oh you will do!
      You will do jussst fine!” he hissed quietly in excitement as he watched you intensely walk further and further
      into
      its domain., unaware that the large imposing snake was drawing nearer to you.<br><br>

      From behind he looked you over in more detail as he continued to drool ever so slightly, his tail wiped away at
      the
      saliva, not wanting to let you know immediately what his plans for you were. "Excussss me" he said, his tail
      gently
      tapped your shoulder. Your entire body stiffened momentarily as you slowly turned around.<br><br>

      Brushing through the tall grass you take your first steps into dense the overgrowth, leaving civilization further
      behind with each step you take. The intensity of the humid heat picks up as you venture more, birds sing as
      various
      other animals emit sounds of life. Despite lacking other humans, the jungle was full of various species all hidden
      by the immense foliage.<br><br>

      You travelled for a while longer, replaying the scene in your head over and over ready to give up everything for
      him
      to exist and take Mowgli's palace in those strong inescapable coils. Your heart raced as the sounds of the
      wildlife
      slowly got more quiet, something made all the other animals stay away, until finally the only noise was made by
      you
      as you brushed past large leaves, and stepped on the large blades of grass.<br><br>

      You took a deep breath and began to repeatedly call out to him, slightly embarrassed over the act, but reminding
      yourself you were alone and no one would judge you. Unaware that your wildest fantasy was closer than you imagined
      as from high above a lone creature had been observing you.<br><br>

      A thick brown python with dark spots running down its immeasurable length slowly smiled as he licked his scaly
      lips.
      "Oh my. What'sssss thissssss I ssssee hmm" he whispered as a soft chuckle escaped him. "Perhapsssss I sssshould
      take
      a clossser look at my curiousss guessst" and with that, the thought to be fictional snake slowly slithered down
      from
      the treetops towards you, his prey who somehow knew his name.<br><br>

      From behind he looked you over, drooling ever so slightly “Oh you will do! You will do jussst fine” he thought
      internally as his tail wiped away at the saliva, not wanting to let you know immediately what his plans were.
      "Excussss me" he said, his tail gently tapped your shoulder. Your entire body stiffened momentarily as you slowly
      turned around, recognising the voice.<br><br>

      You nearly jump out your skin as you believed you were the only person in the jungle, you turn around and are
      confused when a strange snake is looking at you and no other human in sight. "Di... did you just speak?" you
      stutter, convinced you heard a voice. "I did indeed” the python said, smiling warmly at you. Unable to form a
      coherent sentence, your mouth open but no words come forth as you question how it's possible, the snake chuckled
      softly "let me introduccce myssself, my name isss Kaa, and you are, he questions, his tail gently stroking your
      cheek in admiration.<br><br>

      Pulling yourself together you finally are able to tell the creature your name, moving your face away from the
      snake's tail, despite the sensation of his scales rubbing your face being quite pleasant. "Hmm, what a lovely
      name”
      he compliments “ ssso tell me, what bringsss you all the way out here? Are you lossst?" picking up on your timid
      disposition he backs his head away slightly giving you a bit more space, his tail strokes his chin in
      contemplation,
      pretending to not pose any threat to you whatsoever. "No" you reply "I'm out here exploring" having a conversation
      with the snake seemed odd, and unbelievable, but he seemed friendly enough, a conclusion you would soon come to
      regret. "I was told that people explored here before and never returned. I'm sure it's a tall tale, but it seems
      like a fun adventure" you laugh, not realizing how true the merchant's words were, and the thing that linked all
      the
      missing people together was right in front of you.<br><br>

      Kaa pondered, his head turned away from you as the gears turned, his tail continued to rub his lower jaw, as he
      tried to think of a good story to tell you. "Ooh!" he exclaims, as his face lights up "Oh how sssilly of me. How
      could it have ssslipped my mind" the snake turned around with a warm smile on his face "You find thisss jungle to
      be
      beautiful yesss? You're tired of all the ssstresss life bringsss hmm? Thossse people did too, they sssimply wanted
      to get away from that, ssso they all traveled to a placcce deeper in the jungle" his tail poked in the direction
      in
      behind you, you turned around and peered into the seemingly endless depths of the Indian jungle "Would you like me
      to ssshow you where it issss hmm?" awaiting your answer he rests his tail on your shoulder, a familiar gesture
      your
      friends had done, though unlike them he was far from a friend you'd want to meet, let alone be in the presence
      of.<br><br>

      You continued to stare ahead into the foreign territory as Kaa looked intently at the back of your head resisting
      the urge to smack his lips once again.<br><br>

      You swallow the lump in your throat, breath irregular, heart racing, hands shaking, you turn around and come face
      to
      face with the thought to be fictional python named Kaa. "Yo...You're really here!" you stutter, as you rubbed your
      eyes in disbelief, believing you were about to wake up in the hotel room disappointed. "Where else would I be?"
      the
      python said, smiling warmly at you, unable to form a coherent sentence as you were star stuck, the snake chuckled
      softly at your strange disposition "Now then, why were you calling out to me? And how do you know my name?" He
      questioned, his tail moved closed and began to gently stroke your cheek in admiration.<br><br>

      You shuddered at the touch of him, the smooth warm tip was enough to make you shake with adrenaline. "I ... I''
      you
      could barely speak as his tail never ceased in touching your face "was... hoping to..." you gulped loudly, as you
      tried to speak to the Indian python who was noticing how you enjoyed his touch rather than be afraid "find you"
      you
      finished as Kaas head lifted up more as your response peaked his interest "Oh, isss that ssso" he chuckled as he
      patted your cheek with every word, while you shivered in response to his playfulness. With a shaky breath you
      confirmed to him that you've known about him for practically your whole life, he was confused wondering how that
      was
      possible, as he never forgot a guest. You gulped loudly once more as your mouth became dry, you knew what he meant
      by guest, and what he was planning for you.<br><br>

      Rather than over complicate things by telling him the truth, you decided to tell him the townspeople warned of a
      snake existing that if met, you'd never be heard from again. Not wanting to alert you to his intentions so soon,
      he
      tried to calm you, assure you that wasn't true, as his tail shifted to the back of your head and stroked it
      lovingly. You closed your eyes briefly and enjoyed the sensation, biting your bottom lip as you eagerly
      anticipated
      the feeling of your whole body wrapped in his coils. You replied that that's why you were actually there, as you
      bit
      your lip more intensely, groaning softly as his face had moved closer to you. You could feel his powerful breath
      blowing on you. Kaa continued to notice you were acting far differently from all the other people he had
      encountered
      before, and while he still acted friendly, he was ready for whatever trick he believed you might pull on him "Oh,
      that'sss why you're here, what do you mean?" You opened your eyes again, Kaa looked intensly at you and smiling
      warmly his tail draped over your shoulders now, with butterflies in your stomach you shook as you raised your hand
      and started stroking his tail with adoration which had begun to squeeze and relax gently, as if he was giving you
      a
      massage "Since I was young I've always had this fantasy involving you" you stated, embarrassed to continue,
      despite
      the fact it was the very snake who would grant you your long sought after experience "Oh, what fantasssy isss that
      then?" he asks, narrowing his eyes as the tail swats your hand away softly and moves to wrap around your neck.
      Your
      breathing pace increases as the feeling is better than any dream you had ever had, wanting nothing more than for
      him
      to strangle you.<br><br>

      You raised your eyebrow as a slight uneasy feeling began to well up inside, "Umm" you hesitated turning to look
      back
      at him, the warm smile still on his face "In there?" you question, pointing behind you into the dark depths of the
      jungle, Kaa nodded friendly and hummed in confirmation. "Sorry, but I would probably get lost" you tell him,
      unsure
      of a better response so quickly. You cross your arms and begin to walk away from the odd snake, away from the
      darker
      depths.<br><br>

      His tail quickly drapes around your shoulder once more like a friend would do when leaning on you "Oh don't worry,
      I
      will take you there, and if you wisssh to leave again I will gladly bring you back. I promissse" you feel his tail
      contracting and relaxing, as if he was trying to massage your shoulders and neck to ease you more into trusting
      him.
      "You have nothing to worry about, and I will make sssure no other creaturesss harm you either, afterall you sssaid
      you wanted an adventure hmm?" his tail continues to rub your shoulders tenderly. An act you question why you were
      allowing him to do it for so long, but you couldn’t deny the sensation was extremely relaxing. You knew he was
      using
      a fraction of his strength as you were well aware of how powerful snakes were, he could have just coiled you up by
      now and squeezed the life out of you, but he hasn't, he came across friendly enough and seemed to mean you no
      harm.
      Unbeknownst to you Kaa loved to play with his food.<br><br>

      A faint smile forms on your face as you relax around Kaa, believing his intentions to be harmless you nod and tell
      him to lead the way. You step aside as he slithers away, his tail beckons you to follow him, which you do, without
      giving much more thought to the danger you were walking into.<br><br>

      As you wander further away from the town you ask Kaa various questions, how can he speak, where did he come from,
      do
      the people in the makeshift village know about him. The snake answers with short replies, how can you speak, he's
      always been here, you can ask them yourself when they get there, laughing as he points out how curious you are,
      and
      internally to himself knowing you bought the idea that the others still exist in a village out here. He frequently
      looks back to make sure you're still oblivious to his true intent with you as a grin appears on his face. “Not
      much
      further now” he assures you.<br><br>

      The two of you finally reached a small clearing deep in the jungle, sunlight filtered through the leaves in the
      canopy high above, a small lake with crystal clear water flowed gently to the side, vibrant flowers scattered
      throughout, trees with thick bodies, a testament to the hundreds of years it’s been since they were young
      saplings.
      You take in the serene view around, as Kaa's face comes closer to you.<br><br>

      "Well" another gulp, and a gasp as you feel his tail move slightly to hold you more firmer "I've heard stories
      from
      my youth that should make me fear you, make me stay away, but that's not the case... You see… I've always dreamed
      about encountering you so you could ..." You take deep breaths despite the excitement you were still a little
      nervous, part of you was asking if it would be worth it "Could?" Kaa inquired as you moan faintly in response to
      the
      coil around your neck gripping only a fraction firmer as you piqued his curiosity, even the slightest change in
      pressure was enough to make you see stars. "Wrap me up in your strong coils, squeeze me, then..." You closed your
      eyes, steeling yourself to finally admit out loud your fantasy that would be a one way trip. "And then?" he hissed
      with suspense. You could practically hear the interest picking up even more in his voice as the tip of his tail
      once
      again stroked your cheek as if to motivate you.<br><br>

      You gupled loudly, the tail briefly stopping stroking your cheek as a result, before resuming to stroke your face
      tenderly "Swallow me whole... and... alive" A slight creaking sound rang out as the grip around your throat grew
      more intense, you gasped loudly in sudden shock as you look at Kaa who appeared to have a more sinister smile on
      his
      face as he chuckled in ill intent "My my. You know who I am, what I am, and yet ... you long for that
      experienccce,
      do you?" He looks at you and for what felt like an eternity of shared silence, you finally gained your composure
      enough to nod, and a near whisper of confirmation was made.<br><br>

      Kaa laughed uncontrollably loudly as the coil around your neck vibrates violently, he removed it then wiped away a
      tear in his eyes "I mussst sssay I have never in all my yearsss, came acrossssss anyone willing to be a feassst
      for
      me, but why passssss up sssuch a rare oppertunity asss thisss" Boasting over your strange desire, but not
      complaining about a meal either way, the great Indian python slithered over to a more darkened area that lead to a
      deeper part of the jungle "Let'sss go sssomewhere more sssecluded hmm. I have a ssspecial place where I think you
      know what happensss to thossse who crossssss pathsss with me. Come" he said as his tail patted you on the back
      firmly in encouragement. You walked towards him, and together ventured into the deeper depths of the Indian
      jungle.<br><br>

      Ignoring the snake closing the gap between you both, a small hint of annoyance briefly appears across Kaas face as
      you walk past him to look around the area some more.<br><br>

      You drink from the refreshing lake, the cold and cleanliness was better than any bottled or tap water you had ever
      drank before. Taking the small flask from your pocket you fill it with the invigorating liquid.<br><br>

      Kaa observes you, deciding it didn't matter if you looked around the area, or quenched your thirst, it was only
      delaying the inevitable. A slight grin appeared on his face as he quietly muttered to himself for you to enjoy the
      freedom while you still could, he silently slid his thick body around the area as you continued to drink from the
      lake, ensuring every which way his coils lurked. A simple precaution he was sure wouldn't be necessary, but always
      good in case things went South. You sighed in content as you were finally rehydrated and ready to go, still none
      the
      wiser to the severe danger you were in.<br><br>

      Wiping the sweat from your forehead due to the humidity of the jungle air, you walked back to the Indian python
      ready to carry on with your travels. Sensing the plan was ready to proceed his face once again moved closer to
      you.<br><br>

      The air becomes more humid as you trek deeper into the jungle, towards a place of no return, the butterflies in
      your
      stomach grows more intense the further you get, each step bringing you closer to your goal.<br><br>

      With a mixture of excitement and nerves, you ask Kaa how much further it will be, he tells you to be patient, and
      it'll be worth the journey as he looks back at you with a sadistic sneer. In return he asks you what made you
      finally seek him out, you replied saying it's a fantasy that's only gotten more stronger as time went one, and
      before you could continue Kaa finished your sentence by stating today was finally the day it could no longer be
      ignored, to which you confirmed. You then asked him if he had eaten any people before "Of courssse, the part in
      thossse ssstoriesss where I ssswallow anyone whole who crossssssesss pathsss with me wasssn't made up. Why, think
      I
      wouldn't be able to take you or sssomething… you'll ssse" he laughed smugly and once again said how strange you
      were.<br><br>

      The two of you finally reached a small clearing deep in the jungle, sunlight filtered through the leaves in the
      canopy high above, a small lake with crystal clear water flowed gently to the side. You take in the serene view
      around knowing this was the place where the deadly act would be carried out, you shook as your emotions were
      overwhelmed, excited and fear, would it be worth it. Kaa tells you you've arrived as he turns to look at you with
      a
      wide grin on his face, he closes the gap between the two of you.<br><br>

      "So Kaa, how much longer do you think it'll be? You said it wasn’t much further, but I still don’t hear anything”
      you asked, looking directly at the snake who's smile began to widen "Ooh, we're already here" you raised your brow
      in confusion and ask him what he means as you were the only two here "Thisss isss the placcce where you will join
      all the othersss" puzzled you begin to ask further questions, a slight feeling of unease began to stir within as a
      strange glint appears in the golden eyes of the giant rock python "Trussst me, you will join them, I can
      assssssure
      you" he snickered, as the glint shined a little brighter "Just trussst in me"<br><br>His soft tail quickly cups

      Once again you refuse Kaas invitation, your hand gently grabs his tail and removes it from your person and begin
      to
      walk away. Kaas head slithers closer so his face is right in front of you "Persistent big guy aren't you" you
      said,
      as you started to get annoyed but not wanting to anger him, unsure what he may do. "Well I jussst love company, I
      get ssso lonely out here afterall" he looks down at the ground and frowns, attempting to gain some sympathy from
      you
      "Then why don't you go hang out in the village then" you retort, the holes in Kaa's story started to fall apart.
      "W…Well" Kaa started, stammering slightly, realising you were pretty quick, he had to make his move now "the thing
      issss" his tail started moving from behind you, though this time it wasn’t to make your feel at ease around him
      "the
      reassson I can't isss" his tail mere inches from the back of your head "there isss no village" and with that his
      tail grabbed the back of your head and firmly held it to continue looking at his face, and before you could blink
      his face pushed into yours as a strange glint appeared in his eyes.<br><br>

      Instinctively you moved your head fiercely to get Kaa's tail off of your head, but it remained firmly affixed, you
      clenched your eyes shut, as the briefest of glimpses at the strange look he has in his eyes made you feel sick
      with
      worry, alarm bells ring out loudly in you to just run, however the tail quickly moved around your waist. You
      stumbled forward trying to regain your balance as Kaa yanked at you pulling you somewhere. Unable to remove the
      thick coil as you push down on the tail that ensares your waist, Kaa keeps guiding you somewhere.<br><br>

      Cautiously you opened your eyes, the surrounding area kept getting darker and darker, clearly he had a place in
      mind, and he was taking you there by force. However you quickly clench your eyes shut again as not before long he
      would turn back around to look at you, a strange captivating swirl of colours in his eyes. He laughed softly at
      your
      reaction “It would be in your bessst interessst if you jussst looked. Trussst me” he suggested and pulled you a
      couple of steps forward.<br><br>

      Eventually the pulling and tugging stopped, at no point did you pleading with the snake have any positive
      response,
      only a laugh from him and another strong pull forward "We're here" Kaa announced. One again you cautiously opened
      your eyes briefly, and saw a small clearing surrounding you, the sound of running water from the nearby
      lake.<br><br>

      Enjoying your measly efforts to remove his tail still Kaa moved thicker portions of his body a few steps behind
      you
      in a messy pile, and teased you once again "Come on" he said softly "I can assssssure you it would be in your
      bessst
      interessst if you jussst looked at me" you clenched your teeth and grabbed firmly at his tail, yelling your
      rejection at his wishes. Digging your fingers into the spongy mass, both the tail and your grip tightened, it
      infuriated you to hear Kaa giggle to himself, clearly he was using no effort to hold such a firm grip on you,
      while
      you were struggling with it. Quicker than you imagined Kaa released you and quickly pushed you backwards.<br><br>

      Your leg caught a thick branch, or so you thought, as you walked away with your arms covering your eyes, and with
      your balance lost you fell to the ground. Opting to take a brief look in order to get your bearings, a sense of
      dread built up, the feeling surrounding you wasn’t grass or dirt more so it felt like the snake's tail but in
      larger
      amounts. They widened and your pupils dilated as you realised your hunch was correct, he pushed you into a pile of
      his scales. Light and dark patches of browns glistened like precious jewels in the diffused sunlight, as the soft
      spongy ground beneath you began to shift, keeping you disoriented, off your balance, you couldn’t get back up, as
      the all too familiar tail reached out to you once more.<br><br>

      "Letsss try that again ssshall we?" the python chuckled, finding your attempt to retreat rather cute. His tail
      wrapped slowly around your ankles, gingerly pushing your legs together. With a few loops made, ending at your
      calves, his thick soft body ceased moving and his tail yanked you towards him.<br><br>

      Laying on the ground you were effortlessly dragged back over to Kaa who looked down at you with a warm smile on
      his
      face "I only wisssh to help you forget about all your troublesss, ssso pleassse no more resssisssting
      hmm?"<br><br>

      You try to prop yourself up as a thick portion of his body rolls over your forehead, weighing you heavily down.
      The
      bulky scales piled quickly as the soft mass moved down your face and travelled down your body till it weighed down
      on your legs. Your panicked breaths breathed in the coils' musky Earthy scent as they continued to pass over you,
      pinning more and more of you down. You shuddered in fear as the coils finally completed their intentions, your
      legs
      wrapped by two coils, and your body pinned down by Kaas heavy mass. All that poked out from under the hefty
      blanket
      was your eyes which he left uncovered, they twitched as the odd python came into view once more, his eyes mere
      inches from your own.<br><br>

      A grimace inducing sneer spread across the Indian pythons face as you were quickly assaulted in a barrage of
      beautiful colours, their brilliance engulfed your vision. Demanding you to accept.<br><br>

      "Umm, before we start Kaa, I have one final request" you announce as his face started getting close to you own
      "Oh,

      as best you could "I know you have a rather unique... ability, but I don't want that" you take a deep breath as
      your
      heartbeat soars "I want to remain awake, the entire time" another low and intimidating chuckle is made by him as
      his
      eyes open wider in shock "my my, not only have you willingly sssought me out, but you wisssh to remain aware asss

      "Umm, before we start Kaa, I have one final request" you announce as his face started getting close to you own
      "Oh,
      isss there, and what isss that hmm?" a sinister chuckle escaped from him as you take a gulp and steady your nerves
      as best you could "I know I'm willing but I'd love to experience your unique ... ability too" another low and
      intimidating laugh is made by him as his eyes open wider in shock "I mussst sssay I'm not sssure how you know
      about
      that, thossse that have ssseen them have never lived to tell that tale. How do you know about it?" he questions,
      curious how it was possible. Unsure how to explain it, you shrug your shoulders and ask him "Does it matter?" he
      pauses briefly before chuckling sinisterly to himself "No I sssupossse it doesssn't, you're here after all, a

      His eyes which began to glow sent a shiver down your spine, your mind finally telling you something was amiss as
      the
      queasy feeling you got was increasing. With some considerable effort you clench your eyes shut and swat his tail
      away. "Wha...What are you doing?" You shout, stuttering ever so slightly as the faint fog in your mind cleared
      up.<br><br>

      Amused at your reaction to such a small effort on his part Kaa chuckled loudly "I told you. Taking you to the
      sssame
      placcce all the othersss went to. Now look at me properly, if you pleassse" his pesky tail once again slithered
      under your chin and held your face up "Open your eyesss" he requested.<br><br>

      Refusing to comply you jerked your head away from the scaly mass, ignoring the pleasant feeling that came with his
      touch, and began to move away from the snake. Enjoying your measly efforts Kaa moved thicker portions of his body,
      that had been sprawled out like an arena, to just a few steps from you in a messy pile, and waited for you to do
      the
      rest for him.<br><br>

      Your leg caught a thick branch, or so you thought, as you walked away with your arms covering your eyes, and with
      your balance lost you fell to the ground. Opening your eyes cautiously to get your bearings, a sense of dread
      built
      up, the feeling surrounding you wasn’t of wood, moreso it felt like the snake's tail but in larger amounts. They
      widened and your pupils dilated as you realized your hunch was correct, you fell into a pile of scales. Light and
      dark patches of browns glistened like precious jewels in the diffused sunlight, as the soft spongy ground beneath
      you began to shift, keeping you disoriented, off your balance, you couldn’t get back up, as the all too familiar
      tail reached out to you once more.<br><br>

      "Letsss try that again ssshall we?" the python chuckled, finding your attempt to retreat rather cute. His tail
      wrapped slowly around your ankles, gingerly pushing your legs together. With a few loops made, ending at your
      calves, his thick soft body ceased moving and his tail yanked you towards him.<br><br>

      Laying on the ground you were effortlessly dragged back over to Kaa who looked down at you with a warm smile on
      his
      face "I only wisssh to help you forget about all your troublesss, ssso pleassse no more resssisssting
      hmm?"<br><br>

      You try to prop yourself up as a thick portion of his body rolls over your forehead, weighing you heavily down.
      The
      bulky scales piled quickly as the soft mass moved down your face and traveled down your body till it weighed down
      on
      your legs. Your panicked breaths breathed in the coils' musky Earthy scent as they continued to pass over you,
      pinning more and more of you down. You shuddered in fear as the coils finally completed their intentions, your
      legs
      wrapped by two coils, and your body pinned down by Kaas heavy mass. All that poked out from under the hefty
      blanket
      was your eyes which he left uncovered, they twitched as the odd python came into view once more, his eyes mere
      inches from your own.<br><br>

      A grimace inducing sneer spread across the Indian pythons face as you were quickly assaulted in a barrage of
      beautiful colours, their brilliance engulfed your vision. Demanding you to accept.<br><br>

      Your mind resists, in the end?<br><br>You're too strong willed - <a class="choice"

      You were a bit taken aback by the soft tail touching you, you raised your eyebrow in confusion as your eyes looked
      down at it for a second. "Hey, what are you..." was all you could say as his tail pushed your chin up again to
      look
      at him. His eyes began to glow which sent a shiver down your spine, your mind telling you something was amiss.
      "Wha...What are you doing?" You say, stuttering ever so slightly as a faint mist began to seep into your
      mind.<br><br>

      Amused at your reaction to such a small effort on his part, Kaa chuckled loudly "I told you. Taking you to the
      sssame placcce all the othersss went to. Now look at me properly, if you pleassse" his tail moved to pat you
      gently
      on the cheek "Keep your eyesss open, and don't resssissst me" he requested.<br><br>

      Unable to refuse, your mouth began to hang open agape as your body began to lean slightly forward toward the eyes,
      wanting more of the strange warmth. Enjoying your positive reaction Kaa hummed faintly "Jussst trussst in me...
      only
      me, and I will ssshow you to your new home" he hissed softly, lulling you into a deeper state.<br><br>

      You eyes slowly began to twitch, one moment they felt heavy and began to close, the next they were wide open as
      your
      pupils begin to shrink. The warm smile on his face grows "Yessssssss" he hisses softly "Give yourssself over to
      the
      light, all will be over sssoon" He gently pats your cheek affectionately in comfort, the encouraging loving
      strokes
      thank you for your compliance.<br><br>

      "That'sss right, look at me, and only me" he demands, as the burst of beautiful colour seemed to increase in
      strength as they sped up. The saturated hues of blues and yellow illuminate your face in a soft glow as your eyes
      drink deeply from it, not once had you been able to resist from the unexpected assault, every muscle in your body
      feels like it deflated, all the tension built up in them drains away and they felt more relaxed than you can ever
      recall. "That'sss it" he cheers you on as your own pupils begin to twitch, your legs turn to jelly and you go
      limp,
      the tail tightened around your jaw suddenly as he moves it around your neck to hold you upright more securely.
      "Almossst there" Kaa assures you, as a lone strand of drool runs down your face. "K...Ka....Kaa, I URK!" unable to
      finish your sentence as the thick coil around you thorat momentarily cinches tightly to choke you, and from the
      unexpected squeeze a ping like sensation surged through your entire body. Your pupils replaced as they mimic the
      snakes own like a reflection, the corners of your mouth upturn as you begin to grin wildly in delight.<br><br>

      You were a bit taken aback by the soft tail suddenly being more forceful with you, you furrowed your eyebrows in
      anger, no longer being as courteous with the snake. "HEY!, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU..." was all you could say before
      the strange glint burst into colour, the eyes began to glow which sent a shiver down your spine, your mind finally
      telling you to just run. "Wha...What are you doing?" You say, stuttering ever so slightly as a faint mist began to
      seep into your mind.<br><br>

      Amused at your reaction to such a small exposure of his power Kaa chuckled loudly Asss I sssaid there isss no
      village, but I ssshall take you to the lassst placcce they were before vanisshing… Now look at me properly, if you
      pleassse" his tail now moved to pat you gently on the cheek "Keep your eyesss open, and don't resssissst me" he
      requested.<br><br>

      Unable to refuse, your mouth began to hang open agape as your body began to lean slightly forward toward the eyes,

      "That'sss right, look at me, and only me" he demands, as the burst of beautiful colour seems to increase in
      strength
      as they speed up. The saturated hues of blues and yellow illuminate your face in a soft glow as your eyes drink
      deeply from it, not once had you been able to resist from the unexpected mental assault, every muscle in your body
      feels like it deflated, all the tension built up in them drains away and they feel more relaxed than you can ever
      recall. "That'sss it" he cheers you on as your own pupils begin to twitch, your legs turn to jelly and you go
      limp.<br><br>

      The tail tightens around your jaw suddenly as he proceeds to move it around your neck to hold you upright more
      securely. "Almossst there" Kaa assures you, as a lone strand of drool runs down your face. "K...Ka....Kaa, I URK!"
      unable to finish your sentence as the thick coil around you thorat momentarily cinches tightly to choke you, and
      from the unexpected squeeze a ping like sensation surges through your entire body. Your pupils replaced as they
      mimic the snakes own like a reflection, the corners of your mouth upturn as you begin to grin wildly in
      delight.<br><br>

      Finally under his spell kaa nuzzles your face gently and laughs "There we go, that'sss a good dinner guessst. Now
      pleassse follow me" you nod weakly, your chin pushing into the coil around your neck as you begin to follow the
      snake.<br><br>

      It takes quite a while, as in your state you walk quite slowly and sluggish, but Kaa didn’t seem to worry, as the
      suspense fueled him, you wander deeper and deeper into the jungle as the Indian python asks various questions, how
      old you were, what were you doing in the city, what is your honest opinion of snakes. It also took a while to
      answer
      as your mind kept wandering off into bliss mid reply, only for Kaa to laugh as he reminded you of the question, as
      a
      large sinister grin spread across his face the closer you got to the sacrificial area.<br><br>

      After walking for so long, your legs start to buckle under you slightly, as the two of you finally reach a small
      clearing deep in the jungle, sunlight filtered through the leaves in the canopy high above, a small lake with
      crystal clear water flowed gently to the side. Had you been alone and aware you would have loved to take a break
      in
      the small lake.<br><br>

      You gulp loudly, hands shaking, the reality of where you are and what you're doing begins to set in. You stare
      intensely at Kaa who grins sadistically at you, knowing the intentions, something you've longed for since youth.
      You
      question if it's really worth ending your life over. "What'sss wrong my dear sssnack" he asks, chuckling to
      himself
      noticing your nervous disposition. "Ssscared?" his tail playfully runs along your chest as your breathing picks
      up.
      "Don't be. I'll be gentle while I... Ssswallow you" he hisses in excitement.<br><br>

      You think about all that you could still do with your life, while you grew tired of the mundane and repetitiveness
      that came with it, your mind convinced you there was nothing stopping you from changing that. Had you been ill, or
      had no way to improve the quality of your life, you may have been able to ignore the building worry more easily,
      as
      you would have rather gone out like thi, but that wasn’t the case. You stood frozen on the spot thinking it over
      carefully as the Indian pythons powerful breath continued to wash over you, waiting for you to respond.<br><br>

      He asked if you were okay as he hissed once again, only more loudly this time. Was it in intimidation, was he just
      excited to feast on you, was he trying to snap you out of it, tempt you to make an impulse decision, to win you
      over
      and appeal to your strange fantasy, you couldn't tell.<br><br>

      You nod timidly, the strange mixture of exhilaration and mortal dread continued to overwhelm you, your hands shook
      as uncontrollably as your breathing as you fumbled with your clothes, all the while Kaa grinned at how clumsy you
      were trying to remove them.<br><br>

      First you removed your footwear, then socks, your feet felt the warm loose soil of the jungle floor, a hum of
      delight rang out from Kaa who motivated you further "Yesssss! Keep going", you smiled at the encouragement as next
      you removed the clothing on your lower half, revealing to him your bare legs and your sex. Looking back up at the
      large snake you noticed Kaa had already started to drool, you flashed a nervous grin, pleased you were so
      appealing
      to him. His stomach couldn't agree more as it began to stir while he smacked his lips in excitement, the groaning
      of
      it intimidated you, knowing it demands you.<br><br>

      Noticing you stopped briefly and looked at the mass where his stomach lay he spoke softly at you "Have no fear,
      Kaa
      here will take good care of you, it jussst wantsss your company" he chuckles softly stroking your face with his
      tail
      once more, knowing how his touch made you melt. You knew full well what he meant as you took a deep breath to give
      yourself time to become accustomed to the persistent grumbling of his stomach, knowing that in a little while that
      sound would be much much louder and closer, before eventually you would appease it.<br><br>

      Finally you removed the last of your clothes and stood naked as the day you were born in front of the Indian
      python.
      He slithered closer to you and began to hiss uncontrollably loudly, his stomach grumbled even more fiercely,
      demanding you right now. An impatient murmur of delight escaped from Kaa as he moved around you, viewing you from
      all angles,heart skipping a beat as you stood there, being assessed by the python. "My my, what a beautiful
      perssson
      you are, I will certainly have fun with you my poor little Sssnack” You shudder uncontrollably as his tail runs
      down
      your now bare chest “but firssst how about we ssslip you into sssomething more comfortable, wouldn’t you agree, or

      Like a delayed lightbulb that finally went off, you took a steady breath as you told Kaa that there was nothing
      wrong and that you could continue, the grin on his face widened as he laughed, telling you how pleased he was to
      hear that. You look up into the treetops and ask him if the act took place up there. The instant he looks up you
      quietly back away, getting some distance between the two of you without alerting him, chastising youself for how
      stupid you were ever come here.<br><br>

      After a few brief seconds as he begins to look back at you, puzzled momentarily as to why you were further away
      from
      him, then it hit him, “and jussst where do you think you are going hmm?” he scolds you, as he darts towards you.
      You
      sprint, fueled by adrenaline, running faster than you had ever done before, making a break for freedom, scoffing
      at
      your naive self who fantasised an encounter with Kaa, something you no longer wished for. Kaa missed as he lunged
      at
      you, shouting as his tail tried to swipe at your feet to trip you up. However he wasn't able to nab you. You could
      hear the loud and fast rustling of leaves behind as Kaa gave chase to you, demanding you to stop, however you
      would
      do no such thing, the sweltering heat of the jungle doesn't make things easy as the intense temperature seems to
      sap
      you of energy. Finally the rustling from behind stopped as you drew close to the town, Kaa shouted at you one last
      time and warned you he'd make you pay dearly for it.<br><br>

      You arrived back at the hotel and regained your breath, after calming down and assuring yourself you were now safe
      you took a shower. For the rest of the day you spent watching tv despite not understanding it, but a good
      distraction. Occasionally your thoughts drifted back to your encounter, you dismissed them telling yourself you
      were
      a fool to ever enjoy the idea.<br><br>

      Tears well up in your eyes as you scream internally, thinking of anything, everything, in a desperate bid to
      distract yourself, to not succumb to the strange mental fog the snake was trying to implant within you, you knew
      his
      intentions were now far from friendly. You felt the body resting on top of you slowly begin to tense up, clearly
      Kaa
      was increasing his efforts. "K.... K.... Kaa" you mumble through his mass pressing against your lips "Ssssssshh,
      it'sss okay, jusssst let your mind ssslip away, it’sss easssier thisss way, trussst me" he states speaking to you
      in
      a soothing manner as if speaking to a crying child.<br><br>

      Time dragged on as Kaa decided he didn't want to risk using more energy to hypnotise you, after all, the long
      arduous task of swallowing you shortly would require a lot of energy on his part to do so. Ending the ever
      expanding
      light show, his regular golden eyes that pierced your very soul returned and the glow illuminating both of your
      faces diminished.<br><br>

      "My my, I mussst sssay, I have never came acrossssss a sssnack before that could resssissst my charm for ssso
      long,
      you ssshould be proud” he snickered “but have no fear, Kaa here will take good care of you" and with his nose
      briefly nuzzling against your face Kaa's own retreats and the tail around you legs tugged roughly, and with one
      swift motion your pants and footwear were removed. "Letsss get rid of thesss extra layersss hmm?" he hissed softly
      as his tail removed your socks. You wanted to struggle, but the bed of muscle on top was too heavy for any real
      chance of escape to be made.<br><br>

      The ever moving tail forced itself back in between the bulky mass as it worked to remove the rest of your
      clothing,
      tears silently fell and were absorbed into the jungles soil as your bare skin felt the ever shifting muscles of
      Kaas
      immense body as he traveled to the top half of your clothing and ripped it off.<br><br>

      "There we go, much better wouldn't you sssay" he asked knowing a muffled response was all you were able to give,
      he
      grinned at your distress as your bare skin was sandwiched between his thick body, which you could perceive the
      powerful muscles flowing underneath the smooth scales, and the dirt of the ground beneath. "Now "How about we
      ssslip
      you into sssomething more comfortable hmm?"<br><br>

      Tears well up in your eyes as the heavy body on top dwarfed your puny strength in comparison, you knew he was
      holding back, and was more than capable of snuffing the life out of you without much effort on his part. You
      nodded
      tearfully accepting your fate, allowing yourself to be overcome but the strange mental mist the snake was trying
      to
      implant within you. You felt the body resting on top of you slowly begin to tense up, clearly Kaa was getting more
      excited as he began increasing his efforts. "K.... K.... Kaa'' you mumble through the mass pressing against your
      lips, just because you accepted your role in the snakes plan, didn't mean you weren't afraid "Ssssssshh, it'sss
      okay, jusssst let your mind ssslip away" he states speaking to you in a soothing manner as if speaking to a crying
      child.<br><br>

      Your eyes slowly began to twitch, one moment they feel heavy and began to close, the next they were wide open as
      your pupils begin to shrink. The warm smile on his face grows "Yessssssss" he hisses softly "Give yourssself over

      your
      compliance.<br><br>

      strength. The saturated hues of blues and yellow illuminate your face in a soft glow as your eyes drink deeply
      from
      it, every muscle in your body feels like it deflated, all the tension built up in them drained away and they felt
      more relaxed than you could ever recall. "That'sss it" he cheers you on as your own pupils begin to twitch, your
      mouth begins to open as your jaw relaxes. "Almossst there" Kaa assures you, as a lone strand of drool runs down

      tightly to choke you, and from the unexpected squeeze a ping like sensation surged through your entire body. Your
      pupils replaced as they mimic the snakes own like a reflection, the corners of your mouth upturn as you begin to
      grin wildly in delight. The fear you once had now replaced by a state of blissful euphoria.<br><br>

      "Sssstand up ssstraight" Kaa hisses in authority, your breathy sigh being taken as confirmation, your legs on
      command feel more stable as you stand up straight once again, a smile appears on the snakes face "That'sss better.
      You want nothing more that to pleassse me yesss?" knowing full well you would do nothing but comply to his whims,
      and as with all the others before you, you nodded weakly in response "And you are relaxed around me, sssafe?" as
      before you could only nod in confirmation to his questions "Oh I'm ssso happy to hear that... but you know, one
      good
      turn dessservesss another. Ssso why don't you be good for me and..." a sinister sneer appeared across his face,
      his
      eyes narrowed "Remove your extra layersss if you pleassse. I want you… and more importantly myssself, to be asss
      comfortable asss possible for thisss ... wouldn't you agree" a lustful moan escaped your mouth as you truly wished
      for nothing more than to please your new friend who you believed to have your best interests in mind.<br><br>

      The thick coil slid around and off of your throat, as the snake moved back to give you plenty of space to fully
      expose yourself to him. Despite the strong hypnosis you were put under, you were able to, albeit it slowly, remove
      all your clothing in front of the snake, who found what was being revealed underneath to be most appealing to
      him.<br><br>

      First you removed your footwear then socks, your feet felt the warm loose soil of the jungle floor, a hum of
      delight
      rang out from Kaa at the sight of them, as he motivated you further "Yesssss! Keep going", next you removed the
      clothing on your lower half, revealing to him your bare legs and your sex.<br><br>

      Unbeknownst to you in your current state, Kaa had already started to drool, his stomach began to stir as he
      smacked
      his lips in excitement. "You are doing ssso well" the grin never left your face, more than happy to be admired by
      the snake, blissfully unaware of his intentions with you, your only motivation was to please him. Finally you
      removed the last of your clothes and stood naked in front of the Indian python. He slithered closer to you and
      began
      to hiss uncontrollably loudly, his stomach grumbled, demanding you. A longing murmur escaped from Kaa as he moved
      around you, viewing you from all angles. "My my, what a beautiful perssson you are, I will cccertainly have fun
      with
      you my poor little... Sssnack, but firssst how about we ssslip you into sssomething more comfortable hmm"<br><br>

    <div id="28" class="section">

      You take another loud gulp and nod in confirmation but assure him you want to see it through to the horrific end,
      Kaa snickered as a result "Sssuch a ssstrange meal you are, I didn't think anyone ssso twisssted like you
      exisssted.
      Now then .... armsss and legsss to the sssidesss if you pleassse" you obeyed his command, and with your whole body
      quivering you stood with your legs together and arms to the side and stood as still as you possibly could, waiting
      for what was about to come.<br><br>

      He grinned intensely at you, as his tail circled your ankles, their soft mass glided smoothly over your ankles
      before feeling rough as it tensed up, securing the first of several loops that would trap you before sending you
      to
      your doom. Your breath hitched as your eyes widened at the feel of the lone coil around your ankles, your own body
      tense up in excitement for a brief moment in response before relaxing again, "My my, do my coilsss excccite you
      that
      much?" he teased knowing full well you were like putty with them, as the single loop tensed and relaxed, making
      you
      respond in kind to the sensation "Yes Kaa! More than you could possibly know'' you confirm, the eagerness in your
      voice apparent, you really had wanted nothing more in your life than this encounter. His smug laughter echoed out
      the empty clearing, as Kaa scoffed at you "I'm not sssure I will ever meet anyone quite like you ever again" he
      chuckles at your moans of lust as his tail tugs to secure another loop around your legs.<br><br>

      He brings his face behind you and rests on your shoulder, the side of his face up against your cheek as you both
      look down at the progression of his coils which move further up. Clearly he was taking his time with you, each
      movement was agonisingly slow, he was teasing you by drawing out the process, he looked up at you, and stated he
      knew how badly you wanted this, and that he's looking forward to the fun he's going to have.<br><br>

      The large Indian python further ridicules you for giving up your life for this one deadly fantasy as another loop
      of
      his smooth scales made its way up to your knees, your hands now trapped in the scaley cocoo. Hissing softly as his
      tail ceased its insidious climb around your body as you flicked your fingers faintly against the soft mass, the
      coils tensed up and compressed firmer, so you could no longer move your fingers. You remained rooted to the spot,
      heart in your throat as your bare skin felt the soft but powerful muscle of Kaas immense body flow like thick
      honey
      over you.<br><br>

      The wicked smirk on his face spread as he smacked his lips loudly in suspense while his tail wrapped itself around
      your bare stomach "what a treat you will cccertainly be" Your face showed less signs of unease as a shy grin
      appeared. His gentle touch enveloped you in their warmth as a soothing hum sang out from Kaa with eyes gently
      folded, a friendly smile on his face as he gently squeezed, forcing a small cough out of you, the smile on your
      face
      grew as you couldn't wait till your full body was coiled and received more intense squeezes from the python. It
      was
      as if the squeeze removed some worry from you.<br><br>

      With your arms fixed firmly to your sides you remained motionless as you did nothing to stop Kaa from further
      wrapping you up with his body. You grinned as widely as him while your chest started to be trapped by the flexible
      tails soft embrace. "Sssuch a good sssnack" he said, praising you for being so brave, or was it foolish, either
      way
      you didn't care "Not onccce resssisssting your fate. I will take good care of you. I promissse" Your body
      continued
      to stay still for him as he secured the new loop with a tight tug, another violent cough forced out of you hastily
      and a lustful moan as more of your body received his velvet like touch, the new squeeze again easing your worries.
      For something that held you so soft, his body certainly had incredible strength behind it, and him requiring no
      effort at all to make you cough conclusively proved that, and it made your heart race in anticipation of bearing
      witness to more of his strength that was yet to come.<br><br>

      Grinning by the increasingly tight mass enveloping you the python quietly giggled to himself, noticing how much
      you
      were enjoying the deadly situation, his tail tugged to secure the new loop around your shoulders, forcing a short
      gasp of air from you before smiling once again, still not complaining at the securing squeezes. Kaa once again
      praised you for doing so well in the face of your own demise, his shiny scales relaxed again pressing into you
      gently, still allowing you to breathe normally. The tops of your feet cushioned by the mounting mass of coils that
      was piling up around you, you tried to wriggle them playfully, to push into his body, however the piled up mass
      was
      too heavy, useless to do anything even if you were having second thoughts now. Your eyes closed gently as you
      sighed
      in bliss as a wet appendage ran across your cheek, Kaas tongue lapped at your flesh, another hum rang out in
      pleasure. Clearly liking the flavour, the body surrounding you vibrated as it groaned in anticipation, a toothy
      smug
      grin crossed your face, pleased that Kaa enjoyed your taste, he backed away and chuckled to himself, as his soft
      tail finally wrapped around your throat. Your breath hitched, awaiting for the next part of the deadly act to
      begin.<br><br>

    <div id="29" class="section">

      You take another loud gulp and nod in confirmation to Kaa who snickered as a result "Sssuch a ssstrange meal, I
      didn't think anyone ssso twisssted like you exisssted, now then, look here if you pleassse" you obeyed his command
      as his tail wrapped around your forehead, you gasped in excitement at the touch of his coil against you. Your
      whole
      body quivering as you brought your arms and legs together to ensure he could easily coil you.<br><br>

      He grinned intensely as a glint shone in his eyes, you offered no resistance to the expanding colour that glowed
      from them. The intense vibrant hues washed over you as your mouth slowly began to drop as your own eyes drank the
      intoxicating display the Indian python used to sway you. "That'sss it, sssuch an obedient meal" he praised you,
      offering no opposition to his advances.<br><br>

      Finally as some droll begins to run down your face his tail releases you and circled your ankles,their soft mass
      gliding smoothly over your ankles before tensing up, securing the first of several loops that would trap you
      before
      sending you to your doom. Your breath hitched as your eyes begin to feel heavy, your body tenses up in excitement
      for a brief moment in response before relaxing again, "My my, do my coilsss excccite you that much?" he questioned
      as the single loop tensed and relaxed repeatedly, making you respond in kind to the sensation "Y...Y...Yess
      K...K...Kaa" you confirm in a breath sigh, already finding it difficult to form coherent speech as the corners of
      your mouth twitch to a grin, you really had wanted nothing more in your life than this encounter. His smug
      laughter
      echoed out the empty clearing, as Kaa scoffed at you "I'm not sssure I will ever meet anyone quite like you ever
      again" he chuckles at your moan faintly while his tail tugs and secures another loop around your legs.<br><br>

      After one last intense wave of colours his eye return to normal, he giggles at your condition and boldly claims
      that
      he's looking forward to the fun he's about to have, the large Indian python ridicules you for giving up your life
      for this one deadly fantasy as another loop of his smooth scales made its way up to your knees your hands now
      trapped in the scaley cocoon. He hisses softly as his tail ceases its insidious climb around your body
      momentarily.
      You remain rooted to the spot, only twitching your toes slightly in the dirt as Kaas immense body flows like thick
      honey over you.<br><br>

      The wicked smirk on his face spread as he smacked his lips loudly in anticipation while his tail wrapped itself
      around your bare stomach "what a treat you will cccertainly be" Your face showed no signs of resistance as the
      large
      goofy grin remained. His gentle touch enveloped you in their warmth as a soothing hum sang out from Kaa who
      returned
      his mesmerising gaze on you "but it ssseemsss you aren't fully under jusst yet. One moment if you pleasse" A
      friendly smile on his face as he gently squeezes, forcing a small cough out of you, the smile on your face grows
      wider as more of your mind turns to a thick sludge, it felt formless, much like your perception of your
      surroundings.<br><br>

      With your arms fixed firmly you would be powerless to stop him if you awoke and began to regret your foolishness,
      however in your current blissfully unaware state you remained motionless as you did nothing to stop Kaa from
      further
      wrapping you up with his body. You grinned as widely as him while your chest started to be trapped by the flexible
      tails soft embrace. "Sssuch a good sssnack" he said, praising you for being so brave, or was it stupidity, either
      way you didn't care "Not onccce resssisssting your fate. I will take good care of you. I promissse" Your body
      continued to stay still for him as he secured the new loop with a tight tug, another cough forced out of you
      hastily
      and a quiet lustful moan as more of your body received his velvet like touch. For something that held you so soft,
      his body certainly had incredible strength behind it, and him requiring no effort at all to make you cough in
      convulsion proved that, Kaa would make sure you'd bear witness to more of his strength that was yet to come,
      albeit
      under his intense spell.<br><br>

      Grinning by the increasingly tight mass enveloping you the python quietly giggled to himself, noticing how much
      you
      were enjoying the situation, his tail tugged to secure the new loop around your shoulders, forcing a short gasp of
      air from you before smiling once again. Still not complaining by the securing squeezes, not offering any
      resistance
      or signs of waking up, truly this was something you had always dreamed of.<br><br>

      Kaa once again praised you for doing so well in the face of danger, his shiny scales relaxed again pressing into
      you
      gently, still allowing you to breathe normally. Your eyes closed gently feeling heavy despite being well rested, a
      sign that his hypnotic power dwarfed your free will, you sighed in bliss as a wet appendage ran across your cheek,
      Kaas tongue lapped at your flesh, another hum rang out in pleasure, clearly liking the flavour, something you were
      barely aware of. The body surrounding you vibrated as it groaned in anticipation, a large grin remained affixed on
      your face as Kaa backed away, his soft tail finally wrapped around your throat. The intimidating Indian python
      chuckled heartily as the next part of the deadly act was about to begin.<br><br>

    <div id="30" class="section">

      You were unable to sleep as the intimidating appearance of Kaa plagued your mind. You recalled all the years you
      wished to have an encounter with him, now having met him the enjoyment was only brief as you started to be scared
      of
      the idea.<br><br>

      You sighed, unable to take your mind off of it, feeling unsafe despite being in your hotel room, like after
      watching
      a horror film as a kid, you try to convince yourself with logic so you could rest and relax, however the
      irrational
      part of your mind refused to settle down. Grabbing your phone, certain you wouldn't sleep right until you were
      long
      gone from this place you booked an earlier flight home. Hastily you packed all your belongings in your suitcase
      and
      got your small carry-on bag ready before heading to the airport to return home.<br><br>

      Several hours passed since you escaped from the sinister snake and you looked out the window at the jungle that
      grew
      smaller and smaller the higher you got in the air. Curious if you should ever tell the bizarre community you once
      belonged to that Kaa was real, and if you wanted to encounter him for real you'd tell them where to find him. You
      shrugged it off, knowing they'd believe you were crazy, but then again maybe some members would, like you, be
      engrossed in the idea that they'd be willing to take a risk, and there was a strong possibility like you they'd
      come
      to regret it, only Kaa wouldn't make the same mistake he mae with you and he wouldn't let his guard down. You
      closed
      your eyes, finally relaxed and safe from the Indian python, you drifted off to sleep as you told yourself to be
      grateful for your life. You encountered a thought to be fictional snake, and lived.<br><br>

      ENDING J<br><br>

    </div>
    <div id="31" class="section">

      That night you tossed and turned, the intense heat kept you awake, you opened the window beside the balcony in the
      hopes you'd be able to cool down, you lay on the bed sweating slightly, exhausted and just wanting to sleep and
      wait
      out the next few days before leaving.<br><br>

      After hours you were too tired to be kept awake anymore as you drifted off, breathing deeply, a noise that was
      heard
      just outside the window. Kaa had waited at the edge of the jungle waiting for nightfall when all the people turned
      in for the night, the large python had never dared enter the town, however his rage made him take a risk tonight.
      Once the coast was clear he slithered out of the jungle and into the town, his sense of direction dictated by your
      lingering scent, he had made sure to memorise it, no one had ever escaped from him before, and he wasn't about to
      let you slip from his grasp.<br><br>

      He slithered up to a building, your scent emitted from an open window next to a balcony, he grinned sadistically,
      "Oh you left me a way in. What a consssiderate little sssnack" he giggled quietly to himself as he inched closer
      to
      your window, he cautiously peeked in, seeing you tossing and turning restlessly. He bunched up in a pile under
      your
      window, waiting for you to fall asleep.<br><br>

      A craving hiss rang out as Kaa finally heard you sleeping deeply, he peeked once more to confirm and wasting no
      time
      he slithered into the room, his coils falling silently onto the carpet. He smacked his lips as he looked at your
      sweaty naked body, the heat too intense to sleep with the covers, or clothes on. “I sssee you’ve been waiting for
      me” he chuckles almost in a whisper, knowing you didn’t open the window, or got naked for him.<br><br>

      Slowly and gently his tail began to wrap around you, in your exhausted state you only mumbled in your sleep and
      didn't wake, a response that pleased the Indian python who smacked his lips once again. As his tail finally
      reached
      around your neck his nose touched yours as he looked at you from above "Thought you could essscape from me hmm" he
      hissed as his coils tightened around you, sealing your fate.<br><br>

      Your eyes finally opened wide as you choked, you tried to move your arms or legs, but your whole body was being
      crushed. The world came into focus and your lip quivered in fear as you looked at the Indian python, your body
      fully
      wrapped. The pressure refused to ease, refused to let you make a sound, you tried in vain to thrash around,
      however
      the mattress absorbed all sound, the guests next door would be none the wiser to the situation in your room
      "Though
      I mussst thank you for giving me a way in, you mussst have felt bad leaving me all hungry hmm?" he chuckled softly
      knowing full well you hadn't expected his return "Well then letsss not delay thingsss thisss time ssshall we" and
      with that your pupils dilated in fear as the mouth opened in front of you face. You stare helplessly into his wide
      open maw as his powerful breath washed over you, unable to utter even a whimper of protest as his jaws closed
      firmly
      over your face, a longing hiss deafened you inside as he began to feed.<br><br>

      Not once throughout the grim process did he offer any chance of resistance or to make any noise. He had expertly
      swallowed you up, his body creaked as you sank deeper into him. With a smug grin plastered on his face Kaa watched
      intensly as his body pushed you inexorably further inside him, shuddering as your movements brought great joy to
      him. The loud creaking of his scales, evidence of how impressive his body was in keeping its prey captive, you
      were
      his now and he was never going to let you go. The movements in his throat caused small whimpers from within as his
      stomach's protests grow louder and louder with each little push, a horrific indiciation of your imminent doom
      drawing nearer. From outside you could hear the muffled chuckling of the snake as he assured you you'd pay for
      running away, as he sent you to the place where all his prey ventured to and meet their end.<br><br>

      Similar to entering his throat a tight band of muscle seperated you form his stomach, the crown of your head
      pushed
      into it, you screamed in terror as the band of muscle began to open and accept your head, through your screams Kaa
      giggled and wished for you to have fun in there. As the rest of your body began to join your face in the gut you
      noticed how spacious it was compared to the claustrophobic folds that guided the rest of your body in. A new
      unfamiliar bubbling sound began to start as you noticed the stomach began to stir, more of your body sloshed
      around
      inside his churning gut as the tight ring closed off tightly behind the soles of your feet forever. Kaa patted his
      stomach with his tail, pleased another meal was trapped inside.<br><br>

      It took a considerable amount of time with the extra weight but the Indian python managed to safely slither away
      with you back out the window and towards the jungle, still no one around to save you as you struggled weakly
      unable
      to do anything to prevent your grim fate. The leaves brushed over the moving bulge as Kaa had at last made it back
      to the jungle, this time you were forced to return, and you couldn't run away from him. Whether you liked it or
      not,
      you finally had the encounter you used to naively fantasise about.<br><br>

      ENDING K<br><br>

    </div>
    <div id="32" class="section">

      Your breath hitched as the tail returned to your now bare ankles, the soft but strong muscles started its slow
      climb
      up your body. His gentle touch enveloped you in their warmth as a soothing hum sang out from Kaa with eyes gently
      folded, a friendly smile on his face.<br><br>

      You groaned in fear, as response to your thighs now feeling the tail trapping you in their embrace. "Don't be
      afraid" he said, noticing the weak wriggling you made in vain "I will take good care of you. I promissse" Your
      belly
      twitched slightly as he secured a loop around your bare stomach, the unstoppable tail had half of your body in his
      clutches, your hands trapped to your side in the scaly cocoon. For something that held you so soft, his body
      certainly had incredible strength behind it.<br><br>

      Your muffled moans cried out from under the heavy mass as the python giggled to himself, his tail tugged to secure
      the new loop around your chest, his shiny scales pressed into you gently, still allowing you to breathe normally,
      you closed your eyes and exhaled slightly from the sudden yank, your feet twitched from under the pile of muscle,
      useless to do anything.<br><br>

      Your eyes opened wide in dread as a wet appendage ran across your soles, Kaas tongue lapped at your feet, another
      hum rang out in pleasure, clearly enjoying your taste, the body pinning you down vibrated violently as it began to
      awaken and groan in anticipation. You kicked wildly in protest, Kaa backed away and chuckled to himself, as
      nothing
      you could do would stop the tail, as it finally wrapped around your throat.<br><br>

      The Earthy scent of Kaa's body was replaced by the jungle air as his body finally slid off, no longer needing to
      pin
      you down as he had efficiently coiled you up. "Now then" he announced, his face pressing into you once more
      "Sssinccce you tassse oh ssso delisssiccciousss, I will grant you one lassst chanccce to be blissssssfully
      unaware"<br><br>

      The coils around your body shifted around you, the one around your neck grew thicker as his tail moved to hold
      your
      forehead in place, ensuring you both locked eyes once again. Kaa offered you this one final chance to accept the
      mesmerising colours.<br><br>

      Fearfully you?<br><br>Accept your doom and allow the colours to overtake you - <a class="choice"
        value="37">Continue</a><br><br>Resist one last time, there has to be a way to escape - <a class="choice"
        value="38">Continue</a><br><br>

    </div>
    <div id="33" class="section">

      With your mind no longer present Kaa chuckles as his eyes return back to normal and shakes his head as he
      chuckles.
      The heavy mass begins to slide over you, freeing your body once again, only this time you made no attempt to
      escape
      him. You remained still like an obedient servant, grinning wildly with a brilliant display of colours expanding
      endlessly from your eyes. Kaa looks at you, grinning in return "why aren't you leaving?" he asks mocking you as
      you
      remain completely oblivious to your chance at escape "Are you sssure you want to be my meal?" knowing full well
      you
      wouldn't had you not been so enthralled by his rather persuasive power. "Well then, have no fear, Kaa here will
      take
      good care of you" the large Indian python ridicules you in your state as he retreats, the tail around your ankles
      tugging roughly, and with one swift motion your pants and footwear were removed. "Letsss get rid of thesss extra
      layersss hmm?" he hissed softly as his tail removed your socks. You remained blissfully unaware as your bare skin
      felt the soft but powerful muscle of Kaas immense body flow like thick honey over you.<br><br>

      "There we go, much better wouldn't you sssay" he asked knowing you were too far gone to respond, he grinned at
      your
      own one spread across your face, as his tail removed the top half of your clothing. "Now ...How about we ssslip
      you
      into sssomething more comfortable hmm?" the wicked smirk on his face spread as he smacked his lips loudly in
      anticipation, as he studied your naked body "what a treat you will cccertainly be"<br><br>

      Your face showed no signs of resistance as the tail returned to your bare ankles, it started its slow climb up
      your
      body once more. His gentle touch enveloped you in their warmth as a soothing hum sang out from Kaa. With his eyes
      gently folded a friendly smile spread on his face as he gently squeezed, bringing your legs together firmly,
      smacking his lips once again in excitement.<br><br>

      With your arms already at your sides you remained motionless as you did nothing to stop Kaa from trapping your
      arms.
      You grinned widely, unbothered as your thighs and hands were next to be trapped by the flexible tails soft
      embrace.
      "Sssuch a good sssnack" he said, praising you for being so obedient to him "I will cccertainly take good care of
      you. I promissse" Your body continued to stay still for him as he secured a loop around your bare stomach, the
      unstoppable tail had half of your body in his clutches, your hands trapped to your side in the scaly cocoon. For
      something that held you so tenderly, his body had incredible strength behind it, but there was no real need to use
      it, only for his own twisted enjoyment.<br><br>

      Still unbothered by the increasingly heavy mass enveloping you, the python quietly giggled to himself, his tail
      tugged to secure the new loop around your chest, forcing a short gasp of air from you before smiling once again,
      his
      shiny scales relaxed again pressing into you gently. Still allowing you to breathe normally, your feet poked out
      from under the pile of muscle, useless to do anything even if you were awake now. You closed your heavy eyes
      gently
      and sighed in bliss as a wet appendage ran across your soles, Kaas tongue lapped at your feet, another hum rang
      out
      in pleasure, clearly enjoying your unique taste, the body surrounding you vibrated as it groaned in anticipation.
      You remain still despite the rather ticklish sensation on your sensitive soles, Kaa backed away and chuckled to
      himself, as his soft tail finally wrapped around your throat.<br><br>

      Kaa snickered as you obeyed his new command, you stood with your legs together and arms to the side and stood
      perfectly still as his tail circled your ankles. Their soft mass glided smoothly over your ankles before tensing
      up,
      securing the first of several loops that would trap you before sending you to your doom. You remained still like
      an
      obedient servant for him, grinning widely with a brilliant display of colours expanding endlessly from your eyes.
      Kaa looks at you, grinning widely in return "Sssuch a good dinner guessst you are" he praises you as you remain
      completely still, unable to make any attempt of escape "You cccertain you want to be my meal?" knowing full well
      you
      wouldn't had you not been so enthralled by his rather persuasive power. "Well then, have no fear, Kaa here will
      take
      good care of you" the large Indian python ridicules you in your state as another loop of his smooth scales made
      its
      way up to your knees. He hisses softly as his tail ceases its insidious climb around your body to secure the coils
      around you so far. You remained blissfully unaware as your bare skin felt the soft but powerful muscle of Kaas
      immense body flow like thick honey over you as they continue to advance.<br><br>

      The wicked smirk on his face spread as he smacked his lips loudly in anticipation while his tail wraps itself
      around
      your stomach "what a treat you will cccertainly be" Your face showed no signs of resistance as the hypnosis
      remained
      like a thick black out curtain, it allowed for none of the world to penetrate it, offering you no glimpse to the
      outside world. His gentle touch enveloped you in their warmth as a soothing hum sang out from Kaa. With eyes
      gently
      folded, a friendly smile on his face as he gently squeezed, forcing a small cough out of you. A slight chuckle
      escaped him at your reaction to such a slight squeeze.<br><br>

      With your arms already fixed firmly to your sides you remain motionless as you do nothing to stop Kaa from further
      wrapping you up with his body. You grinned as widely as him while your chest started to be trapped by the flexible
      tails soft embrace. "Sssuch a good sssnack" he said, praising you for being so obedient to him "Not onccce
      resssisssting your fate. I will take good care of you. I promissse" Your body continued to stay still for him as
      he
      secured the new loop with a tight tug, another cough forced out of you hastily. For something that held you so
      soft,
      his body certainly had incredible strength behind it, and him requiring no effort at all to make you cough
      conclusively proved that.<br><br>

      Unbothered by the increasingly tight mass enveloping you the python quietly giggled to himself, his tail tugged to
      secure the new loop around your shoulders, forcing a short gasp of air from you before smiling once again.
      Remaining
      unbothered by the securing squeezes, his shiny scales relaxed again, pressing into you gently, still allowing you
      to
      breathe normally. The tops of your feet cushioned by the mounting mass of coils that was piling up around you,
      useless to do anything even if you were awake now. Your eyes closed gently as you sighed in arousal when a wet
      appendage ran across your cheek, Kaas tongue lapped at your flesh, another hum rang out in pleasure, clearly
      enjoying your taste, the body surrounding you vibrated as it groaned in anticipation. You remained still despite
      the
      rather grim intentions the snake was confirming by tasting you, Kaa backed away and chuckled to himself, as his
      soft
      tail finally wrapped around your throat.<br><br>

      You choked briefly as an overly excited Kaa tightened his grip on you fiercely, forcing all the precious air out
      of
      you. It was easily the tightest squeeze he had put on you thus far, sweat began to pour out of you as if he was
      squeezing water from a sponge. You bit your bottom lip as you emitted a low groan, the sensation was better than
      even the most realistic dreams you had of the scenario, your body began to writhe in pleasure as you started to
      wheeze. Kaa giggled to himself, asking if you were enjoying yourself as he loosened his grip on you, your chest
      suddenly heaving heavily as you regained your breath confirming to him that you did.<br><br>

      You asked to be constricted again but even tighter this time, a dark sneer spread over his face as Kaa chuckled
      heartily and shook his head. "I'm ssso glad to hear that" he states, knowing full well if it was too intense he
      wouldn’t stop, only remind you that you asked for it. He giggles to himself as he begins to slowly squeeze your
      sweaty naked body once again, not showing any signs of discomfort as his coils increase the pressure around you
      slowly this time. You look at each other, as the pressure gradually began to force the air out of you, the smile
      on
      your face not once showing signs of discomfort, only bliss as you continued to gasp in pleasure while losing your
      precious air supply "Hmm, I wonder if you have a limit" he pondered and began to constrict you even further, the
      colour in your face slowly began to drain as he held it. He waited till you were on the brink of passing out, your
      body continuing to writhe in pleasure as he once again relaxed around you and allowed you to breathe, knowing that
      you truly admired his strength and enjoyed being subjected to its immense power. When you were breathing
      comfortably
      again, he asked if you wanted more, his smug grin an indication that he enjoyed playing with you, your eyes closed
      in bliss and your eyebrows upturned as you nodded, and he was more than happy to continue as he started the
      torturous to all but you, process all over again.<br><br>

      The sun travelled across the sky as the day moved on, sweat had continued to run down your face as the latest
      intense session of squeezes finally stopped for a moment. The head of the Indian python moved to your still
      grinning
      face, you were exhausted, the life was squeezed out of you, but at no point did you scream, beg, or try to escape,
      you enjoyed every intimate moment, every powerful and slow squeeze, begging for more as he laughed, degrading you
      .
      His nose softly pushing into the bridge of your own, as Kaa bagan smacking his lips in anticipation "Now then,
      let'sss be on our way hmm?" he chuckled, your grin only grew as you knew what the snake spoke of.<br><br>

      With your mind showing no signs of waking up with the intense squeeze Kaa chuckled heartily as he shook his head.
      "I'm ssso glad your mind isss ssso easssy to manipulate. Tell me, do you like my coilsss?" He asks, knowing full

      The gradual build up of pressure slowly begins to force the air out of your lungs once more, and like before the

      Tears silently fell as you know there is no escape, despite holding you gently you knew Kaa like all snakes could
      squeeze the life from you with relative ease.<br><br>

      Looking at him you nod faintly, resigning yourself to your fate. The warm smile on his face grows at your
      confirmation "Yessssssss" he hisses softly "Give yourssself over to the light, all will be over sssoon" his tail
      slides off your forehead, knowing you won't try to resist. He gently pats your cheek affectionately, the loving
      strokes thank you for your compliance.<br><br>

      "Now look at me, and only me" he orders, as the familiar glint in his eye returns, his pupils expand and from
      their
      darkness a sudden burst of beautiful color emerge. The saturated hues of blues and yellow illuminate your face as
      your eyes drink deeply from it, no longer trying to resist every muscle in your body feels like it deflates, all
      the
      tension built up in them drains away and they feel more relaxed than you can ever recall. "That'sss it" he cheers
      you on as your own pupils begin to twitch, while your mouth begins to open as your jaw relaxes. "Almossst there"
      Kaa
      assures you, as a lone strand of drool runs down your face. "K...Ka....Kaa, I URK!" unable to finish your sentence
      as the thick coil around you thorat momentarily cinches tightly to choke you, and from the unexpected squeeze a
      ping
      like sensation surged through your entire body. Your pupils are replaced as they mimic the snakes' own like a
      reflection, the corners of your mouth upturn as you begin to grin wildly in delight. The fear you once had now
      replaced by a state of blissful euphoria.<br><br>

      With your mind no longer present Kaa chuckles as his eyes return back to normal, you eyes continue to swirl and
      expand with the wonderful colour, he shakes his head as he tuts. "I'm ssso glad you finally sssee thingsss my way.
      Tell me, do you like my coilsss?" He asks, knowing full well you were too far gone to respond, he giggles to
      himself
      as he begins to slowly squeeze your limp body, not showing any signs of discomfort, as he treats you like a pet
      squeeze toy. His coils increase the pressure around you, beginning to force the air out of your lungs, but still
      the
      goofy smile plastered across your face remains as you gasp more and more "I'll take the sssilenccce asss a yesss"
      he
      concludes and begins to constrict even further.<br><br>

      The sun rose high in the sky as the intense squeezing sessions continued, hours passed as the day turned into
      evening, sweat had formed faintly on your face as a rather intense round of squeezes finally stopped for a moment.
      The head of the python moved to your still grinning face, not once complaining, only wheezing and coughing in
      response to the vice like grip he’d subject you to. He gently pushed his snout into the bridge of your nose, Kaa
      bagan smacking his lips in anticipation as he looked down at you "Now then, let'sss be on our way hmm?"<br><br>

      in vain to reassure you "It'sss okay" he hisses softly "Give yourssself over to the light, all will be over
      sssoon"
      his tail holds your forehead, forcing you to look directly at him. He gently pats your cheek affectionately, the

      "Now look at me, and only me" he asks, as the familiar glint in his eye returns, his pupils expand and from their

      as
      your eyes twitch and well up with tears in response, your body automatically resisting the urge to give in.
      Desperate every muscle in your body feels like it turns to concrete as it tenses up, as if it was absorbing the
      strange sway the snake was trying to lull you into. The tension builds up in them, your jaw clenched so tight you
      were sure your teeth would shatter with the pressure, you grunt through your teeth as his coils increase their
      pressure on you, trying to disrupt your intense focus, the breaths expelled sharply through your nose "Ssssshhh"
      he
      tries to soothe you his tail once again stroking your cheek softly in a friendly manner, but you knew his
      intentions
      with you were far more insidious. "It'sss in your bessst interessst to give in. Trussst me" Kaa assures you, his
      tail moving around your neck. As you talk with fury through your teeth "K...Ka....Kaa, YO-URK!" unable to finish
      your sentence as the thick coil around you thorat momentarily cinches tightly to choke you, from the unexpected
      squeeze you managed to close your eyes shut tight, the instance connection you both shared severed.<br><br>

      With your mind seemingly impenetrable, Kaa chuckles as his eyes return back to normal and shakes his head. "Well
      then, have it your way, but I asssure you, my way would have been far better for you. Tell me, do you like my
      coilsss?" He asks, knowing full well how disgusted you were with him, he giggles to himself as he begins to slowly
      squeeze your tense body, groaning out in dread as you were powerless to stop him from toying with you. His coils
      increase the pressure around you, beginning to force the air out of your lungs, but still you refused to open your
      eyes, afraid he was still counting on winning you over with the bizarre light show. You gasped, unable to answer
      him, unsure what you could say, or offer him, in exchange for your life "I'll take the sssilenccce asss a yesss"
      he
      concludes mockingly and begins to constrict you further.<br><br>

      The sun rose high in the sky as the day slowly passed by, sweat had begun to run down your face as the rather

      briefly nuzzled against your nose, his warm breath washed over your face.<br><br>

      The large mass once again tensed up around you as Kaa tightened his grip, slowly your body left the jungle floor
      as
      you began your ascension into the treetops with the python. Learning his lesson Kaa made sure the branches above
      were free from any fruit, he wouldn't risk losing you as his meal for a second time.<br><br>

      From above a large fruit finally ripe fell from the thick branch. A smug Kaa looked back at your intense glare
      looking up at him, knowing full well what awaited you above, he giggled softly to himself and turned back around,
      his eyes widened as he caught a brief glimpse before the heavyweight made contact and smacked him in the face.
      Both
      of you cried out as both the pair of you fell back to the ground.<br><br>

      The dirt rose around you both in a dense cloud, you cough and wheeze the fall while being broke in your scaley
      cocoon still managed to wind you, regaining some composure you turn to look at an unmoving Kaa who was out like a
      light, the fruit smashed open nearby, it's contents spilled on the jungle floor, Kaa's snout accented with
      splotches
      of the sweet pink substance.<br><br>

      With your breath regained and Kaa still knocked out you shook with fear as his thick mass laid on you like a heavy
      blanket. You looked down at the bulky length of browns and blacks resting on you. You turned slowly to see the
      snake
      still out cold, the pink substance coating his face, the ground, and some of it still inside the cracked open
      fruit.
      You took a deep breath and hoped you'd be able to escape without waking Kaa. Slowly and gently you pull up your
      shoulders to remove your arms from the coils, making as little movements as possible in the hopes it wouldn't stir
      Kaa. The soft spongy mass moves instinctively as it tightens around you a little. Your breaths came in short rapid
      bursts as he was still alive, your wish that the fall killed him wasn’t granted. Fueled by adrenaline you continue
      to try and free your arms, you begin to struggle, panic taking over as the mass tightens its grip a little more
      with
      each struggle. Like some sort of unconscious ability the Indian python possessed, it wasn't long before it was
      difficult to breathe as the coils now squeezed you with an almost unbearable force. Exhausted as you ceased
      struggling, the coils slowly relaxed around you once more, unable to escape as moving only caused it to tense up
      again.<br><br>

      You gasped in dread as nearby a groan of discomfort finally broke the silence, you looked over in horror as the
      snake began to stir, it's coils relaxed a little as it moved like a wave seemingly to get their bearings on you,
      holding you more softly as before, but still too snug to free yourself. Kaas' tail rubbed the top of his snout in
      a
      soothing manner, the sticky substance drying off. "Oooh" he grumbled again "That wasss rather unfortunate" his
      eyes
      finally opened "Ooh, how rude of me to forget my dinner guessst" Kaa looked over and chuckled heartily seeing you
      staring back at him with an intense glare "Oh thank goodnessssss you're ssstill with me, guesss you didn't want to
      leave after all hmm?" he hissed in excitement, knowing full well you would have tired to but his grip was
      unyielding, he moved his face closer to yours. "Let'sss try again hmm" he asked as his snout briefly nuzzled
      against
      you, his warm breath washed over your face. You shook your head away in disgust, gasping as he tightened the coil
      around you throat in response.<br><br>

      The large mass once again tensed up around your whole body as Kaa tightened his grip, slowly your body left the
      jungle floor as you began your ascension into the treetops with the python once more. Learning his lesson Kaa made
      sure the branches above were free from any fruit, he wouldn't risk losing you as his meal for a second time. Your
      screams and begging did nothing but amuse Kaa.<br><br>

      You think of your life, how boring and repetitive it came, apart from this business trip you had rarely ever left
      your town. The voice inside your head rose up to say if you were bored that's no reason to let it end for one
      strange fantasy, nothing was stopping you from changing careers. You thought it would have been too risky to do
      that, only to laugh as your current predicament, wrapped in the coils of a snake who plans on eating you, was a
      far
      bigger risk. You close your eyes and take deep breaths, recalling how you felt each time you had had enough and
      the
      fantasy was no longer needed as you went about your day. What would all of those versions of you think?<br><br>

      You took a deep sigh and realised they'd want it to be over as well and get on about your day, and now you'd be
      able
      to recall your experience in vivid detail from now on. You smiled sadly and realised it was the right thing to do,
      and without any further questions you pulled your arms out of the scaly bands and pushed them off of you.
      Apologising to the Indian python for ending things prematurely, but thanking him for the awesome experience, free
      you walk over to Kaa and pat him on the head. You grab your clothes and walk away, getting dressed as you further
      yourself from him.<br><br>

      Finally the sun begins to set as you make it back to the town, the same merchant from the morning was closing his
      shop. You get back to your room and throw yourself onto the bed, your mind drifting aimlessly as you fall
      asleep.<br><br>

      You awake the next morning your body aches as it finally feels the effect of Kaa's intense squeezes, a small price
      to pay for an amazing experience you thought, though you wondered if leaving was the right thing to do. With no
      work
      left to do you remained in bed, moving as little as possible as you recovered.<br><br>

      The day of your departure arrived and you packed your belongings, your body now back to normal, you stepped out
      onto
      the balcony and looked out at the jungle one last time. The intense encounter replayed in your mind, as it had
      done
      for the past few days, it refused to leave you alone, each waking minute you spent still wondering if leaving was
      right, part of you constantly saying it was the wrong choice, that you’d regret it for the rest of your life, or
      drive you mad until you saved up enough money to return.<br><br>

      You looked at your packed bags, once you took them out the door in a few hours you wouldn't be back, then you
      looked
      out at the jungle again, you still had a chance to return right now. You bit your bottom lip and shook our head,
      knowing how messed up it was to even consider seeking him out once, let alone return to him. You once again weigh
      your options to leave and return to your old life, or give into the increasing regret and seek Kaa out again,
      unsure
      if he’d hypnotise you again or not.<br><br>

      before,
      you began to smile like a goof ball, while he once again laughed as your mind melted . His tongue flicked out,
      finally noticing what the sweet smell was. He looked to the side and saw the fruit. "Well then, letsss be on our

      As his own eyes adjusted to the surroundings Kaa regained consciousness, his head throbbing with pain. He groaned
      out in discomfort as a thick portion of his body rubbed over the top of his head in a soothing manner. His senses
      kicked in as he moved his body, realising he couldn’t feel anything struggling against him. He turned to look and
      saw his coils empty “Oh please, sssay it isssn’t ssso” he pleaded, moving his body around to make sure you weren’t
      trapped underneath. Finding nothing his stomach ached and complained loudly, his tail wrapped around the thickest
      part of the broken branch and crushed it with relative ease "Oh why did you fail to sssupport me and that tasssty
      little sssnack hmm" he spoke with disappointment, knowing you'd be well on your way to the village.<br><br>

      A slight grin appeared across his face as he tossed the broken branches away. "Hmm maybe thisss can work in my
      favour... “Yesss. Sssurely they will warn the othersss about me, and they will have to return to ssshow them where
      I
      am … Looksss like I'm about to have a lot of diner guessstsssssss Tsss Hsss Hsss” He laughed joyfully as he
      slithered into some nearby bushes. Unaware if you would dare tell the others about him or not.<br><br>

      You think of your life, how boring and repetitive it came, apart from this business trip you had rarely ever left
      your town. The voice inside your head rose up to say if you were bored that's no reason to let it end for one
      strange fantasy, nothing was stopping you from changing careers. You thought it would have been too risky to do
      that, only to laugh as your current predicament, wrapped in the coils of a snake who plans on eating you, was a
      far
      bigger risk. You close your eyes and take deep breaths, recalling how you felt each time you had had enough and
      the
      fantasy was no longer needed as you went about your day. What would all of those versions of you think?<br><br>

      You took a deep sigh and realised they'd want it to be over as well and get on about your day, and now you'd be
      able
      to recall your experience in vivid detail from now on. You smiled sadly and realised it was the right thing to do,
      and without any further questions you pulled your arms out of the scaly bands and pushed them off of you.
      Apologising to the Indian python for ending things prematurely, but thanking him for the awesome experience, free
      you walk over to Kaa and pat him on the head. You grab your clothes and walk away, getting dressed as you further
      yourself from him.<br><br>

      Finally the sun begins to set as you make it back to the town, the same merchant from the morning was closing his
      shop. You get back to your room and throw yourself onto the bed, your mind drifting aimlessly as you fall
      asleep.<br><br>

      You awake the next morning your body aches as it finally feels the effect of Kaa's intense squeezes, a small price
      to pay for an amazing experience you thought, though you wondered if leaving was the right thing to do. With no
      work
      left to do you remained in bed, moving as little as possible as you recovered.<br><br>

      The day of your departure arrived and you packed your belongings, your body now back to normal, you stepped out
      onto
      the balcony and looked out at the jungle one last time. The intense encounter replayed in your mind, as it had
      done
      for the past few days, it refused to leave you alone, each waking minute you spent still wondering if leaving was
      right, part of you constantly saying it was the wrong choice, that you’d regret it for the rest of your life, or
      drive you mad until you saved up enough money to return.<br><br>

      You looked at your packed bags, once you took them out the door in a few hours you wouldn't be back, then you
      looked
      out at the jungle again, you still had a chance to return right now. You bit your bottom lip and shook our head,
      knowing how messed up it was to even consider seeking him out once, let alone return to him. You once again weigh
      your options to leave and return to your old life, or give into the increasing regret and seek Kaa out
      again.<br><br>

      After some serious thinking you?<br><br>Resist the urge - <a class="choice" value="72">Continue</a><br><br>Regret

      The branch, which had been a favourite of Kaas, had finally taken too much of his immeasurable weight as it
      snapped.
      Kaa cried out in surprise, as both he and you fell back to the ground, instantly he was out cold the second he
      landed on the floor, his soft coils around you cushioned the fall that otherwise would have been fatal to a
      human.<br><br>

      The swirling mass of colours grew fainter as the fog in your mind slowly began to clear, you breathed out heavily
      as
      a dizziness engulfed you, your brain felt like it was spinning constantly like some strange hangover. You slowly
      began to perceive a heavy mass laying on you as your eyes suddenly shot open wide in realisation. You looked down
      and saw nothing but a bulky length of browns and blacks resting on you. Turning your head in a panic you saw the
      snake out cold, a thick branch and numerous large splinters littered the floor around you both. Finally piecing
      together what must have happened you hastily pushed the coils off of you. The soft spongy mass moved with some
      considerable effort as your breaths came in short rapid bursts, clearly fueled by adrenaline as you raced to
      escape,
      not wanting to stick around and find out if he was knocked out or killed by the high fall.<br><br>

      Finally you managed to pull your feet free from the coils and wasting no time you hastily grabbed your clothes and
      ran back towards the hotel. No longer taking your thought to be a boring life for granted. No longer yearning for
      an
      adventure. No longer being naive to peoples warnings over the potential dangers that may lurk in the jungle. In
      all
      the years of Kaas life, you had been the first to ever escape from his clutches.<br><br>

      As his own mind fog dissipated Kaa regained consciousness, his head throbbing with pain. He groaned out in
      discomfort as a thick portion of his body rubbed ov-er the top of his head in a soothing manner. "Well" he started
      as the pain began to ease "I mussst apologissse for my carelesssnesss, ssshall we continue my delectiable sssnack
      hmm?" he asked smugly as he turned his head towards the mass of coils. "WHAT!" he shouted in shock, quickly moving
      his coils around to make sure you weren't fully covered, noticing you had managed to escape his tail wrapped
      around
      the thickest part of the broken branch and crushed it with relative ease "Oh why did you fail to sssupport me and
      that tasssty little sssnack hmm" he spoke with disappointment, knowing you'd be well on your way to the
      village.<br><br>

      A slight grin appeared across his face as he tossed the broken branches away. "Hmm maybe thisss can work in my

      With a commanding hiss cut off his maw closed gently over your face, as he started the lengthy swallowing process,
      the crown of your head pressed against the entrance to his throat. The soft palate of his mouth vibrated over your
      wide ginning face as he hummed in delight at the first proper taste of you. His saliva dripped onto your face
      which
      made it clear how blissfully unaware you were of the dire situation, as you did nothing but remain still as you
      were
      partially inside the maw of a notorious snake.<br><br>

      His coils re-positioned around you, squeezing more air out of you, you gasped forcefully into his mouth and in
      return he hissed in triumph, taking his time, savouring his meal, just like he had done with all the others who
      were
      unfortunate enough to cross paths with him. Kaa's coils moved in powerful waves freeing your neck from the
      persistent strangling that he enjoys inflicting upon you. His maw opens wide and the tight ring that separates
      your
      current location to the deadly oesophagus above begins to open slowly and welcome you in.<br><br>

      The opening expanded slowly over your forehead like a slick rubber band gliding smoothly as your coiled-free neck
      began to enter the warm humid mouth of Kaa. Never once being aware of your current predicament, smiling joyfully
      throughout the whole grim situation as the flesh ran down your nose while your forehead received the touch of his
      many folds. they slapped gently into more and more of your face as it entered the hot sticky throat, helping to
      push
      you further inside to your imminent demise. The moist walls shook gently as Kaa hummed in delight once more,
      salivating wildly at your taste. A gentle breeze ran down your throat as Kaa hissed softly, his tongue licking
      your
      neck with wild carnality, the coils around you tightened strongly, another gasp escaped into the seemingly
      infinite
      folds inside of the python, squeezing you even further in response, something Kaa did when he truly enjoyed a
      meal,
      and he thought you were one of the best he's ever had.<br><br>

      With only your head swallowed the great Indian python was shuddering in sheer pleasure, anticipating the moment
      when
      he finishes you off. Finally his mouth closed gently over your neck, and Kaa gave another tight squeeze around
      your
      body, your eyes closed, brows upturned in response as another breath was forced out of you, the branch bouncing
      slightly under his tremors, as the snake giggled at the weak muffles in response from within.<br><br>

      A thick hazy fog slowly cleared, the colour in your eyes dulled as the swirls shrunk, the smile on your face
      slowly
      dropped as your cheeks began to sense how tired they were from the wide grinning. You gasped softly, your mind
      slowly waking up from a strange groggy state. "What happened?" you wonder as you begin to move your hand and rub
      your eyes. Your arms unable to budge, they were stuck firmly to your sides, you looked down and like a dam
      bursting,
      your memory came flooding back as the glistening scales moved around more, tightening the grip around you and
      forcing you to exhale.<br><br>

      A harsh breeze blew from above, accompanied with a longing hiss. Your eyes widened in horror as you looked up, the
      opened maw of the snake grew closer and closer to you. You struggled intensely, sweat ran down your forehead as
      the
      vice-like grip around your neck tightened more, coughing in convulsion as Kaa made breathing even more difficult
      for
      you, a chuckle escaped the great maw of the Indian python as he was now aware of your sober state.<br><br>

      The breaths were raspy and shook as you clenched your eyes shut just as your features felt the mouth of the snake
      push firmly into your face, your entire head now inside the maw of Kaa. The crown of your head pressed against the
      entrance to his throat, as the soft palate of his mouth vibrated over your face while he hummed in delight, his
      saliva dripping onto your face your tried in vain to resist, thrashing your head side to side, but his mouth had a
      firm grip on your face.<br><br>

      His coils reposistion around you, squeezing more air like a squeak toy, you gasped into his humid mouth and in
      return he hissed in triumph, taking his time, savouring his meal, just like he had done with all the others who
      were
      unfortunate enough to cross paths with him. His coils moved in powerful waves freeing your neck which had been
      repeatedly strangled intensely by the Indian python. His maw opens wide and the tight ring that separates your
      current location to the deadly oesophagus above begins to open slowly to welcome you in. Your muffled screams
      cried
      out in protest, begging the snake to release you, however Kaa paid no heed to your complaints, he already had you
      trapped in your coils, and had no desire to hypnotise you again. He giggled as his tongue playfully stroked across
      your cheek, relishing in the sensation of your trying to move away from it in disgust.<br><br>

      The opening expanded slowly over your forehead like a slick rubber band gliding smoothly as your coiled-free neck
      began to enter the warm humid mouth of Kaa. The air inside an unpleasant scent, toxic to your nose which scrunched
      automatically in response to the new muggy environment. The flesh ran down your nose as your forehead received the
      touch of his many internal folds, they slapped gently into more and more of your face as it entered the hot sticky
      throat, helping to push you further inside to your imminent demise, your muffled moans once more ran out as the
      moist walls shook gently, the wriggles made Kaa hum in delight always enjoying his meals struggling as opposed to
      just remaining still, salivating wildly at your taste.<br><br>

      A gentle breeze ran down your throat as Kaa hissed softly as his tongue lapped at your neck, your breathing became
      more erratic, part fear over the escalating danger you were in, and part the coils around you which tightened with
      an almost bruising pressure. Your gasps escaped into the seemingly infinite folds inside of the python, squeezing
      you in response, something Kaa did when he truly enjoyed a meal, and he thought you were one of the best he's ever
      had, managing to wake up faster than any prior prey he had captured.<br><br>

      With only your head swallowed the great Indian python was shuddering in sheer pleasure, anticipating the moment
      when
      he finishes you off. Finally his maw closed gently over your neck, Kaa gave another tight squeeze around your
      body,
      your eyes closed, brows upturned in response as another breath was forced out of you, you started to shake in
      fear,
      the coils tightening their grip even more firmly around you as a result, the branch bouncing slightly under his

      With a commanding hiss cut off his maw closed gently over your face, trapping it inside his mouth, the crown of
      your
      head pressed against the entrance to his throat. The soft pallette of the interior vibrated over your face as he
      hummed in delight as he got his first taste of you, his saliva dripping onto your face which showed signs of
      extreame anger and terror inside the maw of a nutorious snake. His coils re-position around you, squeezing more

      which was useless, but the panic in your mind refused to let you just give up yet. The desperate pleading for your
      life to be spared was only met by Kaas slick tongue caressing your face and a deafening hiss echoed out in the
      claustrophobic space.<br><br>

      The opening expanded slowly over your forehead like a slick rubber band gliding smoothly as your coiled-free neck
      began to enter the warm humid mouth of Kaa. It was certainly a rare experience, but one in which you had never

      Kaa slithered over to you, his face rubbing affectionately up and down your cheek as he chuckled to himself
      "Looksss
      like we are finally here hmm" he announced, his warm intense breath tickled the back of your head. "Now then" the
      coils tightened, forcing the air from your lungs. You exhalled a violent breath as you looked at him with a
      strange
      sense of accomplishment, like your true purpose of life was to feed the Indian python. You flashed Kaa a toothy
      grin
      who chuckled at your eagerness, as his tail yanked firmly. The coil around your neck cinched tighter as a peculiar
      noise was choked out of you "I'm ssso glad to ssse you are enjoying yourssself my ssstrange sssnack. Now it'sss

      You shake your head in disbelief, knowing how messed up it was, but you knew you spent the majority of the days
      recovering unable to think of anything else but your time with Kaa. You knew where the clearing was if he didn't
      show up before reaching it. "Screw it" you think to yourself as you once again make haste for the jungle, knowing
      if
      you were to go back to your old life you’d never once stop thinking about it.<br><br>

      As you walk through the dense foliage you think of various reasons to explain why you left, not wanting Kaa to be
      mad. He still hadn't appeared as you reached the area you met him a few days ago, so you pushed onward into the
      dark
      depths of the jungle, to the clearing where you’d meet your fate.<br><br>

      Your mind made up as this time there was no doubt, the thoughts and practicality of being his meal was too
      intense,
      and had only gotten worse the past few days. You were a fool to leave prior and wished you could have just
      remained
      in the coils till he awoke.<br><br>

      Finally you reached the clearing, and once again called out to Kaa, saying you have returned to him and apologised
      for leaving. "And why did you leave?" he demanded, his voice more dominant, clearly annoyed by your departure as
      he
      hissed in aggression. You looked around, unable to see him "I thought we were having fun" despite him not being in
      view you could now tell he was somewhere above you, watching intensly "Oh we were Kaa" you started, already an
      excuse thought up in your journey of no return "Once you got hit I heard someone nearby, I knew they would harm
      you
      so I quickly got out, got dressed and met with them, we spoke for a while, it took some convincing but I managed
      to
      get them to turn around, as I suggested some drinks on me. Then my body ached from the squeezes so I needed to
      rest
      before returning" you looked around Kaa still not revealing himself to you "and now you've come back to ssse it
      through hmm" a slight sinister chuckle echoed out, clearly he was buying it "Yup" you confirmed, as you hastily
      started to remove your clothes once again. From above you could hear him smacking his lips again, finally you saw
      a
      portion of his body emerge from the treetops high above lowering to you, they coiled around, piling on top of one
      another like a small tower. Eventually he stopped, the tail at the same height as your neck, his tail began poking
      in the small gap inside the coils "Climb insssside and we ssshall pick up where we left off, but know thisss, my
      belly isss too impatient now, ssso there will be no hypnosssisss thisss time" a sinister chuckle rang out.<br><br>

      No longer having second thoughts, and accepting the change of plans as punishment from deserting and lying to him,
      you begin walking over to the side of the small towers of scales, you climb on the rock next to him, feeling the
      eyes of Kaa watching you carefully from above. You look down at the coils, slowly you sit on the topmost one as
      you
      stuck your legs inside, the thick mass beneath your butt jolted slightly, motivating you to slip down as his tail
      patted you on the back in encouragement "what are you waiting for, it isss what you want hmm?" he asked, and with
      the smile once again plastered on your face you took a deep breath to calm your nerves, put your arms to the side
      and slid down.<br><br>

      Immediately once your feet touched the ground his coils closed around you like a vice, the breath forced out of
      you
      as your bare feet left the loose dirt. A sensation you missed and couldn't stop thinking about during your
      recovery,
      you sighed in content as you were being pulled up into the trees to encounter Kaa once again.<br><br>

      A thick hazy fog slowly cleared, the colour in your eyes dulled and the wonderful spiral shrunk, the smile on your
      face slowly dropped as your cheeks began to sense how tired they were from the wide grinning. You gasped softly,
      your mind slowly waking up from a strange groggy state. "What happened?" you wonder as you began to move your hand
      and rub your eyes, unable to. Your mind slowly started to become more sober as your senses started to kick
      in.<br><br>

      Your vision was dark, your sense of feel was wet and muscles ached, your sense of smell assaulted by a rather
      noxious odour, your hearing forced to acknowledge the gurgling and groaning from deeper within. You spread your
      arms
      and legs out, against the slippery mass that expanded but refused to burst. Exhausted you relented and the walls
      bounced back, slapping firmly into you once more. Disoriented you recalled the events before the gap in your
      memory.
      You recalled the warnings of the shop merchant, and being intrigued by a sense of adventure, meeting a talking
      snake
      and… Finally within the darkness a lightbulb went off.<br><br>

      The disappearances weren't a tall tale, it was very real, and you were now one of them, as you too ended up in the
      belly of the snake. "LET ME OUT!" You screamed in protest tearfully "PLEASE!" you begged hoping Kaa would
      eventually
      take pity on you.<br><br>

      Your best efforts were easily thwarted by Kaa whos innards remained unaffected by even your most strident of
      struggles, if it was under different circumstances you'd be in awe over how much the snake could bulge out and
      remain unbothered, how a meal no matter how heavy or light can be effortlessly pushed inside. However with your
      rare
      point of view on the grim act you were far from amazed, and wished humans were an exception to the horrific
      process,
      be it too wide to be swallowed, would cause indigestion, the struggles would be too difficult to contain and
      they'd
      get out, or some other reason, however that wasn't the case, and the grim reality was that humans were just like
      every other animal to a snake.<br><br>

      In hindsight you cursed your morning self, incredibly naive, believing there'd be no real danger, thinking you
      were
      above all animals of the jungle. Kaa had seen to it to remind you of your place on the food chain, and you
      certainly
      existed on it. You begged once more for the Indian pythons mercy<br><br>

      The only response you got was a sinister chuckle, proving how fatal your adventure would turn out to be.<br><br>

      You sigh and return back inside, listening to the more rational opinion. It would be silly to give up the rest of
      your life for one silly fantasy, you were incredibly lucky as it was to come back alive from it, it was a gift
      that
      you weren't going to squander. You hopped in the shower before getting your small carry on bag ready before
      heading
      to the airport to return home.<br><br>

      Several hours passed since your decision and you looked out the window at the jungle that grew smaller and smaller
      the higher you got. Curious if you should ever tell the bizarre community you belong to that Kaa was real, and if
      they were serious about encountering him you'd tell them where to find him. You shrugged it off, knowing they'd
      believe you were crazy, but then again maybe some members would, like you, be engrossed in the idea that they'd be
      willing to take a risk, your fantasy bubbled to the surface knowing you gave the thrilling conclusion of it up in
      order to go on living, you wondered how the inside of his mouth felt, how his throat would expand to accomodate
      you.
      You closed your eyes and recalled the event that you experienced first hand, and told yourself to be grateful for
      that. You encountered a thought to be fictional snake, and lived. A fact that part of you always regretted,
      telling
      you it would drive you insane until you finally gave in and returned. Whether you managed to avoid those desires
      for
      the remainder of your life or eventually returned, ultimately came down to your sheer willpower.<br><br>

      ENDING L<br><br>

    </div>
    <div id="73" class="section">

      You shake your head in disbelief, knowing how messed up it was, but you knew you spent the majority of the days
      recovering unable to think of anything else but your time with Kaa. You knew where the clearing was if he didn't
      show up before reaching it. "Screw it" you think to yourself as you once again make haste for the jungle, knowing
      if
      you were to go back to your old life you’d never once stop thinking about it.<br><br>

      As you walk through the dense foliage you think of various reasons to explain why you left, not wanting Kaa to be
      mad. He still hadn't appeared as you reached the area you met him a few days ago, so you pushed onward into the
      dark
      depths of the jungle, to the clearing where you’d meet your fate.<br><br>

      Your mind made up as this time there was no doubt, the thoughts and practicality of being his meal was too
      intense,
      and had only gotten worse the past few days. You were a fool to leave prior and wished you could have just
      remained
      in the coils till he awoke.<br><br>

      Finally you reached the clearing, and once again called out to Kaa, saying you have returned to him and apologised
      for leaving. "And why did you leave?" he demanded, his voice more dominant, clearly annoyed by your departure as
      he
      hissed in aggression. You looked around, unable to see him "I thought we were having fun" despite him not being in
      view you could now tell he was somewhere above you, watching intensly "Oh we were Kaa" you started, already an
      excuse thought up in your journey of no return "Once you got hit I heard someone nearby, I knew they would harm
      you
      so I quickly got out, got dressed and met with them, we spoke for a while, it took some convincing but I managed
      to
      get them to turn around, as I suggested some drinks on me. Then my body ached from the squeezes so I needed to
      rest
      before returning" you looked around Kaa still not revealing himself to you "and now you've come back to ssse it
      through hmm" a slight sinister chuckle echoed out, clearly he was buying it "Yup" you confirmed, as you hastily
      started to remove your clothes once again. From above you could hear him smacking his lips again, finally you saw
      a
      portion of his body emerge from the treetops high above lowering to you, they coiled around, piling on top of one
      another like a small tower. Eventually he stopped, the tail at the same height as your neck, his tail began poking
      in the small gap inside the coils "Climb insssside and we ssshall pick up where we left off" a sinister chuckle
      rang
      out.<br><br>

      Walking over to the side of the small towers of scales, you climb on the rock next to him, feeling the eyes of Kaa
      watching you carefully from above. You look down at the coils slowly you sit on the topmost one as you stuck your
      legs inside, the thick mass beneath your butt jolted slightly, motivating you to slip down as his tail patted you
      on
      the back in encouragement "what are you waiting for, it isss what you want hmm?" he asked, and with the smile once
      again plastered on your face you took a deep breath to calm your nerves, put your arms to the side and slid
      down.<br><br>

      Immediately once your feet touched the ground his coils closed around you like a vice, the breath forced out of
      you
      as your bare feet left the loose dirt. A sensation you missed and couldn't stop thinking about during your
      recovery,
      you sighed in content as you were being pulled up into the trees to encounter Kaa once again<br><br>

      Your gently folded eyes opened once again revealing how strong his hypnosis power was, never once showing signs of
      resistance, the colours remained, swirling and expanding just as strongly as they did outside. The grin slowly
      spreads across your face again as you recover from another round of intense squeezes. Kaa twisted around you
      roughly, ensuring his jaws could make it over your shoulder, the bulkiest part of every meal, yet none had been
      too
      large for him, and you were certainly no exception as both his jaws pressed down firmly on each of them.<br><br>

      With the Indian python able to accommodate the widest part of you nothing stopped him from being capable of
      swallowing you whole, you, like every other feast, will become just another bulge in the mighty Kaa, lost and soon
      forgotten to the world. Your only purpose now is to fill the belly of the great snake and give your body up to add
      to his own never ending length.<br><br>

      Another rough twist to reposition himself, resulted in a cough from you as his jaws moved around aggressively. Now
      clasping once again on your chest and back, still unbeknownst to you, as your body began to sweat, mixed with the
      sinister snakes drool, it ran down your chest in thick ribbons glistening in the filtered sun. Atop a tree, deep
      in
      the jungle, no one would be coming to save you. Your sludge-like mind unable to comprehend the grave danger you
      were
      in, only smiling away like an obedient servant to the snake, giving your life up for its own. No complaining, no
      struggling, only the occasional cough and wheeze as he constricted you in excitement.<br><br>

      As a coil lazily slid off of your stomach it instinctively expanded, no longer being firmly compacted, unlike your
      wrists and legs which remained trapped in the scaly prison. A grumbling groaned out from further inside as Kaa's
      stomach demanded your company louder than before. The remaining coils around you squeezed firmly as he still
      enjoyed
      every delectable inch of you, with his eyes closed he experienced the utmost delight in making you his
      food<br><br>

      You clench your eyes shut tighter as the sponge like innards clamped fiercely around you to guide you in. You
      groaned in discomfort as Kaa twisted around roughly ensuring his jaws could make it over your shoulders, the
      bulkiest part of every meal, yet none had been too large for him, and you were certainly no exception as both his
      jaws pressed down firmly on each side.<br><br>

      With Kaa able to accommodate the widest part of you nothing stopped him from being capable of swallowing you
      whole,
      you cried out in response, knowing you would be no challenge to consume, like every other feast. Thrashing around
      uselessly you refuse to accept becoming another bulge in the mighty Kaa, lost and soon forgotten to the world.
      Rejecting your only purpose now, which was to fill the belly of the great rock python and give your body to add to
      his own never ending length, a role you were horrified even thinking about.<br><br>

      Another rough twist, resulting in a cough being forced from you as his jaws twisted around you again, now clasping
      on your chest and back, more of your body began to sweat, mixed with the sinister snakes drool, it ran down your
      chest in thick ribbons glistening in the filtered sun. Atop a tree, deep in the jungle, with no one around to
      rescue
      you, a grim fate was being forced upon you, powerless to stop the progression as each wave of the peristalsis
      embraced you, eagerly brushing over your skin in admiration.<br><br>

      As a coil lazily slid off of your stomach it instinctively expanded, no longer being firmly compacted, unlike your
      wrists and legs which remained trapped in the scaly prison. A grumbling groaned out from further inside as Kaa's
      stomach demanded your company louder than before. A small whimper of fear escaped your lips as you shuddered, the
      unpleasant sensation of Kaa's unwavering advances could not be ignored no matter how tight your eyes were shut.
      The
      remaining coils around you squeezed firmly as he still enjoyed every delectable inch of you, with his eyes closed

      A thick hazy fog slowly cleared, the colour in your eyes dulled and the wonderful spiral shrunk, the smile on your
      face slowly dropped as your cheeks began to sense how tired they were from the wide grinning. You gasped softly,
      your mind slowly waking up from a strange groggy state. "What happened?" you wonder as you began to move your hand
      and rub your eyes, unable to. Your mind slowly started to become more sober as your senses started to kick
      in.<br><br>

      Your vision was dark, your sense of feel was wet and muscles ached, your sense of smell assaulted by a rather
      noxious odour, your hearing forced to acknowledge the gurgling and groaning from deeper within. You spread your
      arms
      and legs out, against the slippery mass that expanded but refused to burst. Exhausted you relented and the walls
      bounced back, slapping firmly into you once more. Disoriented you recalled the events before the gap in your
      memory.
      You recalled the warnings of the shop merchant, and being intrigued by a sense of adventure, meeting a talking
      snake
      and… Finally within the darkness a lightbulb went off.<br><br>

      The disappearances weren't a tall tale, it was very real, and you were now one of them, as you too ended up in the
      belly of the snake. "LET ME OUT!" You screamed in protest tearfully "PLEASE!" you begged hoping Kaa would
      eventually
      take pity on you.<br><br>

      Your best efforts were easily thwarted by Kaa whos innards remained unaffected by even your most strident of
      struggles, if it was under different circumstances you'd be in awe over how much the snake could bulge out and
      remain unbothered, how a meal no matter how heavy or light can be effortlessly pushed inside. However with your
      rare
      point of view on the grim act you were far from amazed, and wished humans were an exception to the horrific
      process,
      be it too wide to be swallowed, would cause indigestion, the struggles would be too difficult to contain and
      they'd
      get out, or some other reason, however that wasn't the case, and the grim reality was that humans were just like
      every other animal to a snake.<br><br>

      In hindsight you cursed your morning self, incredibly naive, believing there'd be no real danger, thinking you
      were
      above all animals of the jungle. Kaa had seen to it to remind you of your place on the food chain, and you
      certainly
      existed on it. You begged once more for the Indian pythons mercy<br><br>

      The only response you got was a sinister chuckle, proving how fatal your adventure would turn out to be.<br><br>

      The coils around you vibrate as his gut rumbles, you were certain it was more violent this time, clearly he was
      more
      hungry than a few days ago. Finally you could see the face of Kaa looking at you with his usual smirk, glad to see
      you return back to him "Ssso niccce to sssee you again" he welcomed you, as he placed you onto the branch mere
      inches away from him. It complained loudly under the weight but managed to hold, the slight shifts from Kaa made
      the
      branch creak in response.<br><br>

      Kaa slithered over to you, his face rubbing affectionately up and down your cheek as he chuckled to himself "You
      jussst couldn't keep away hmm" he announced, his warm intense breath tickling the back of your head as you
      shuddered
      in anticipation. "Now then" the coils tightened, forcing the breath from your body, your eyes once again shut
      tight
      and you smiled in response as Kaa held you firmly in place.<br><br>

      Taking his time as he did with all his food the sun continued to rise across the sky, but in your current state,

      gently
      across your stomach, he wriggled the upper jaw side to side to ensure he had a good grip of you before clamping
      down
      firmly, expelling another violent cough from further within the ever expanding prison of muscles and scales. His
      impressive body creaked loudly like rubber being stretched as his body swelled around you, clearly showing your
      form

      Deafening gurgles groaned out within as his stomach continued to be more and more impatient. The thick folds,
      moulded perfectly to your features, vibrated aggressively in response before once again relaxing and resuming its
      usual motion, rubbing softly yet firmly across every inch of your body inside, effortlessly beckoning you in
      further.<br><br>

      Unable to stop drooling over your taste Kaa hissed louly in zeal, knowing he still had half of your body left to

      no
      meal was too much for him to handle, and like all the others you were not giving him any issues.<br><br>

      A loud, wet cracking sound rang out in the surrounding empty area as Kaa's jaws began to open wider and wider
      ready
      to accept his latest meal. You feel a thick warm substance drip on your face as you remain in his thick
      inescapable
      coils, despite resting for a few days, it didn't take as much effort for his squeezing to wear you out. He only
      scoffed at your writhing of pleasure, still shocked you would actually return. You looked up into the wide
      dripping
      maw of Kaa, that was slowly descending onto you, a wide mouth more than capable of swallowing you whole, as you
      would enter his mouth and the dark chasm beyond.<br><br>

      His warm breath washed over your face strongly as he hissed loudly for a considerable amount of time. Excited to
      start his feast, as much as you were excited to be his meal, glad you returned. He manoeuvres his coils around you

      the
      branches creaking loudly once more in response to the shifting weight it supported.<br><br>

      The sound of a plane taking off flew overhead drowned out the sound of the fiery hissing from Kaa. Given how long
      you were walking in the jungle to return to the dominant Indian python you knew that would have been your plane,
      had
      you resisted the urge to see the encounter through to the end you would be on your way back home. As his mouth
      drew
      nearer the saliva flowed down you like a thick gelatinous waterfall, you wondered if you were on that plane, if

    <div id="84" class="section">The warm sticky substance ran down your legs, Kaa never once being put off by your
      flavour a strong breeze blew between them as the immeasurable python hissed softly, his tongue randomly licking
      your
      arms, however the tickling sensation received no response from you. Your mind blissfully numb as it swam in an
      seemingly infinite ocean of euphoria, the warm drool coating you was the waves that lapped at your skin gently.
      Like
      an elysian dream you wish to remain forever trapped in, it felt like everything was the way it should be, you were
      safe, you'd never have a single worry ever again as you sunk deeper into the snake's unforgiving gut, the wave
      carried you further out into the calm endless sea.<br><br>

      Slowly your butt lifted off of the branch, no longer being supported as the tight band glided smoothly along your
      legs to join the rest of you inside, your body coiled less and less, Kaa now no longer needed to move down to
      further swallow you, enough of your body was swallowed up that his folds would pull you in further to your
      imminent
      demise.<br><br>

      A sigh of bliss escaped into squishy crevices of the shifting folds around your face as the band snapped below
      your
      knees. Your hands now joined the many moist folds, fingers slipped in between them as they greedily trapped them
      in
      the pulsing mass of flesh. Kaas maw lifted once again as he forced you inside a few more inches before clamping
      down
      once again around your calves, feet un-twitching as his brilliant display of swirling colours still captivated
      you.<br><br>

      The final coil around your ankle released you as Kaa prepared to swallow again, knowing his meal was almost over
      in
      the next swallow or two, he wondered how effective his light show was on you, if you'd be one of meals that
      remained
      unaware for good, or one of the other people he caught who eventually became aware of their grim fate. The outcome
      didn’t matter to the snake as you were his forever.<br><br>

      Despite being lifted in the air, a good amount of Kaa's mass remained on the branch, still bobbing up and down
      down

      The warm sticky substance ran down your legs, Kaa never once being put off by your flavour as a strong breeze blew
      between them while the immeasurable python hissed softly, earning more struggling from within. His tongue randomly
      licking your arms, the shaking turned into frantic movements as your sensitive skin found the slick tongue to be
      the
      most ticklish sensation you’ve ever felt before. Held firmly by the coils, and his thorat you were unable to make
      Kaa cease his tongue's playful exploration of you, clearly he was enjoying the teasing, much to your protests as
      you
      sunk deeper into the python's unforgiving gut.<br><br>

      Slowly your butt lifted off of the branch, no longer being supported as the tight band glided smoothly along your
      legs to join the rest of you inside, your body coiled less and less, Kaa now no longer needed to move down to
      further swallow you, enough of your body was swallowed up that his folds would pull you in further to your
      imminent
      demise.<br><br>

      A whimper of horror escaped into squishy crevices of the shifting folds around your face as the band snapped below
      your knees. Your hands now joined the many moist folds, fingers slipped in between them as they greedily trapped
      them in the pulsing mass of flesh, your faint wriggles of them did nothing as the slippery folds passed in between
      them. Kaas maw lifted once again as he forced you inside a few more inches before clamping down once again around
      your calves, your feet twitched and kicked to no effect, the small sign of defiance unhindered Kaas
      advances.<br><br>

      The final coil around your ankle released you as Kaa prepared to swallow again, knowing his meal was almost over
      in
      the next swallow or two, he was still shuddering at the feeling of your struggles. Chuckling to himself as he had
      no
      intentions of ever letting you go, despite begging for it, you belonged to him, and he was going to make good use
      of
      your life just as he had done with all the others before you.<br><br>

      Despite being lifted in the air and kicking uselessly, a good amount of Kaa's mass remained on the branch, still
      bobbing up and down down to his never ceasing movements as he continued to process you.<br><br>

      With a commanding hiss cut off his maw closes gently over your face as he begins the lengthy process of swallowing
      you. You grinned with delight as your face was pressed into his mouth, the crown of your head pressing against the
      entrance to his throat. The soft palate of his mouth vibrated over your face while he hummed in delight as he got
      his first taste of you after waiting for a few days. His saliva dripped onto your face which showed no signs of
      regret, only excitement as you finally got to experience what it was like inside the maw of the notorious
      snake.<br><br>

      His coils re-position around you, squeezing more air out of you, you gasp into his mouth and in return he hissed
      in
      triumph. Taking his time, savouring his meal, just like he had done with all the others who were, unlike you,
      unfortunate enough to cross paths with him. His coils moved in powerful waves freeing your neck which had been
      repeatedly strangled intensely by the Indian python. His maw opens wide and the tight ring that separates your
      current location to the deadly oesophagus above begins to open slowly to welcome you in, you sighed in content,
      not
      afraid of your now imminent doom, instead you moaned in pleasure as Kaas slick tongue caressed your face and a
      deafening hiss echoed out in the claustrophobic space. Clearly both of you enjoyed the grim process.<br><br>

      The opening expands slowly over your forehead like a slick rubber band gliding smoothly as your coiled-free neck
      begins to enter the warm humid mouth of Kaa. It was certainly a rare point of view, and just like the touch of his
      coils, and the intense squeezing they had given you, being eaten was better than your wildest dreams. The flesh
      ran
      down your nose as your forehead received the touch of his many slippery folds, they slapped gently into more and
      more of your face as it entered the hot sticky throat, helping to push you further inside to your imminent demise.
      You started to blush slightly as the folds rubbed over your face, your nose slipped in between them as you
      breathed
      in the strange musky smell. The moist walls shook gently as Kaa hummed in delight again due to your coughing at
      his
      musk, it wasn't an unpleasant smell, but one you hadn't expected. A gentle breeze ran down your throat as Kaa
      hissed
      softly, his tongue licking at your neck, your breath shaky as your body quivers in exhilaration. The coils around
      you tighten strongly, and a shaky gasp escapes into the seemingly infinite folds inside of the python. Squeezing
      you
      hastily in response when swallowing you was something Kaa did when he truly enjoyed a meal, and he thought you
      were
      one of the best he's ever had.<br><br>

      The snake had only swallowed your head and already he was shuddering in sheer pleasure over you. Finally his maw
      closed gently over your neck, Kaa gave another tight squeeze around your body, your eyes closed, brows upturned in
      response as another breath was forced out of you, Kaa giggled at the weak muffles from within knowing you were
      enjoying being swallowed up by him just as much as he was enjoying devouring you.<br><br>

      After a few brief moments the folds over your face begin to make it hard to breathe, instinctively you move your
      face for air, but the internal muscles refuse to allow that as they continue to smother all that was swallowed up.
      Paired with the intense squeezes from the muscles that forced more air out of you a moment of realisation finally
      came over you. Like waking from a strange dream you began to ask yourself what you were doing, why you were giving
      your life up for this, the reality of the encounter was turning into a nightmare.<br><br>

      You gasped softly, as you tried in vain to resume enjoying yourself again, after all this is what you always
      dreamed
      of, you even ventured into the jungles hoping to find him without giving much of a second thought, and now part of
      you wished to bail out. The regret and fear in your mind only continued to build in severity as your hearing was
      forced to acknowledge the gurgling and groaning from Kaa's digestive tract.<br><br>

      You spread your arms and legs out, as your survival instinct at long last kicked in, no longer wanting to be a
      meal,
      the long sought after fantasy should have remained just as that as you would like all the others end up in the
      belly
      of the snake. You thrashed around wildly as best you could. "LET ME OUT!" You screamed in protest, horrified over
      your predicament "PLEASE!" you begged. Kaa only emitted a mumble of a laugh,the prison around you shook rather
      violently as a result. Kaa couldn't care less if you were having second thoughts, as he was a creature without
      mercy.<br><br>

      A thick hazy fog slowly cleared, the colour in your eyes dulled and the wonderful spiral shrunk, the smile on your
      face slowly dropped as your cheeks began to sense how tired they were from the wide grinning. You gasped softly,
      your mind slowly waking up from a strange groggy state. "What happened?" you wonder as you began to move your hand
      and rub your eyes, unable to. Your mind slowly started to become more sober as your senses started to kick
      in.<br><br>

      Your vision was dark, your sense of feel was wet and muscles ached, your sense of smell assaulted by a rather
      noxious odour, your hearing forced to acknowledge the gurgling and groaning from deeper within. You spread your
      arms
      and legs out, against the slippery mass that expanded but refused to burst. Exhausted you relented and the walls
      bounced back, slapping firmly into you once more. Disoriented you recalled the events before the gap in your
      memory.
      You recalled the warnings of the shop merchant, and being intrigued by a sense of adventure, meeting a talking
      snake
      and… Finally within the darkness a lightbulb went off.<br><br>

      The disappearances weren't a tall tale, it was very real, and you were now one of them, as you too ended up in the
      belly of the snake. "LET ME OUT!" You screamed in protest tearfully "PLEASE!" you begged hoping Kaa would
      eventually
      take pity on you.<br><br>

      Your best efforts were easily thwarted by Kaa whos innards remained unaffected by even your most strident of
      struggles, if it was under different circumstances you'd be in awe over how much the snake could bulge out and
      remain unbothered, how a meal no matter how heavy or light can be effortlessly pushed inside. However with your
      rare
      point of view on the grim act you were far from amazed, and wished humans were an exception to the horrific
      process,
      be it too wide to be swallowed, would cause indigestion, the struggles would be too difficult to contain and
      they'd
      get out, or some other reason, however that wasn't the case, and the grim reality was that humans were just like
      every other animal to a snake.<br><br>

      In hindsight you cursed your morning self, incredibly naive, believing there'd be no real danger, thinking you
      were
      above all animals of the jungle. Kaa had seen to it to remind you of your place on the food chain, and you
      certainly
      existed on it. You begged once more for the Indian pythons mercy<br><br>

      The only response you got was a sinister chuckle, proving how fatal your adventure would turn out to be.<br><br>

      You exhalled a sigh of utter content as the sponge-like innards clamped fiercely around you to guide you in. You
      moaned lustfully as Kaa twisted around roughly ensuring his jaws could make it over your shoulders, the bulkiest
      part of every meal, yet none had been too large for him, and you were certainly no exception as both his jaws
      pressed down firmly on each of your shoulders.<br><br>

      With Kaa able to accommodate the widest part of you nothing stopped him from being capable of swallowing you
      whole.
      A toothy grin appeared on your smug face, thrilled that nothing would prevent the Indian python from fully
      swallowing you now, your fate was guaranteed now, and you were ecstatic. You cried out in anticipation as Kaa once
      again moved another inch down your body, you knew it was only a matter of time before you'd be utterly lost and
      soon
      forgotten to the world, and yet you did nothing to prevent that from happening. You chuckled faintly telling
      yourself how messed up you were. Your only purpose now is to fill the belly of the great rock python and give your
      body to add to his own never ending length, a role since childhood you secretly longed for.<br><br>

      Another rough twist, resulting in a cough being forced from you as his jaws twisted around you again, now clasping
      on your chest and back, more of your body began to sweat, mixed with the sinister snakes drool. It ran down your
      chest in thick ribbons glistening in the filtered sun. Atop a tree, deep in the jungle, with no one around to
      rescue
      you, and hoped none would come, a grim fate forced upon you. Even if you did have second thoughts you'd have been
      powerless to stop the progression as each wave of the peristalsis embraced you eagerly brushing over your skin in
      admiration.<br><br>

      As the coils lazily slid off of your stomach it instinctively expanded, your diaphragm reacted instantly to the
      lesser pressure, no longer being firmly compacted. A grumbling groaned out from further inside as Kaa's stomach
      still demanded your company. A small shudder escaped your lips as the folds once again embraced you softly and
      rubbed over you. The remaining coils around you squeezed firmly still enjoying every delectable inch of you, his

      The groans from within grew louder as you were completely unaware how closer you were getting to the belly of the
      powerful Kaa. It became more impatient for nourishment as the horrific act had been intentionally prolonged, but
      the
      python was patient and had as always ignored the urge to swallow you up quickly, just as he had done with all his

      adrenaline kicking into overdrive as the snake was so close to finishing you off, the folds clamped down firmly
      and
      shook violently as Kaa once again laughed at your predicament, both knowing he was never going to let you go.
      Tears
      began to well up and fall silently down your face, mixing with his saliva, you whispered in a shaky voice,
      pleading
      for his mercy. Your feet being the only thing left to consume twitched and kicked still showing what little signs
      of
      protest you could. The groans from within grew louder as you were forced to acknowledge how closer you were
      getting
      to the belly of the powerful Kaa. It became more impatient for nourishment as the horrific act had been
      intentionally prolonged, but the python was patient and had as always ignored the urge to swallow you up quickly,
      and instead chose to endure his body's complaints to hurry up, in exchange for savouring his rare meals, and in
      your
      case, of waking up early, was exceptionally a rare treat for him, and one he enjoyed prolonging longer than
      usual.<br><br>

      Kaa gently lowered both of you onto the branch, now laying across it, the jungle air flowed in between your toes,
      which wriggled in vain as his tongue playfully tickled your soles. You howled in laughter despite the situation
      being far from funny, thrashing around in a desperate bid to escape his playful tongue as it once again explored
      your sensitive flesh. The thick drool ran down your feet as your tears of horror turned into tears of laughter,
      the
      ticklish sensation was more intense than your arms had received. After a few moments his tongue retreated and you
      breathed heavily after your laughing fit.<br><br>

      The powerful breath of Kaa washed over your feet again as his mouth opened to finally finish the job and seal you
      away for good, he hissed, saliva spraying out in thick strands as he slowly moved his head forward. The mouth
      pushed
      into your soles as it closed around them securely. He closed his eyes gently and moved his head up to the sky,
      your
      feet slipped to the back of his mouth, and the ring of muscle started to accept the last of you.<br><br>

      Struggling was useless, begging only amused Kaa, there was nothing to stop you from slipping further down the
      bowles
      of the beast. His belly vibrated wildly, demanding your company.<br><br>

      A thick hazy fog slowly cleared, the colour in your eyes dulled and the wonderful spiral shrunk, the smile on your
      face slowly dropped as your cheeks began to sense how tired they were from the wide grinning. You gasped softly,
      your mind slowly waking up from a strange groggy state. "What happened?" you wonder as you began to move your hand
      and rub your eyes, unable to. Your mind slowly started to become more sober as your senses started to kick
      in.<br><br>

      Your vision was dark, your sense of feel was wet and muscles ached, your sense of smell assaulted by a rather
      noxious odour, your hearing forced to acknowledge the gurgling and groaning from deeper within. You spread your
      arms
      and legs out, against the slippery mass that expanded but refused to burst. Exhausted you relented and the walls
      bounced back, slapping firmly into you once more. Disoriented you recalled the events before the gap in your
      memory.
      You recalled the warnings of the shop merchant, and being intrigued by a sense of adventure, meeting a talking
      snake
      and… Finally within the darkness a lightbulb went off.<br><br>

      The disappearances weren't a tall tale, it was very real, and you were now one of them, as you too ended up in the
      belly of the snake. "LET ME OUT!" You screamed in protest tearfully "PLEASE!" you begged hoping Kaa would
      eventually
      take pity on you.<br><br>

      Your best efforts were easily thwarted by Kaa whos innards remained unaffected by even your most strident of
      struggles, if it was under different circumstances you'd be in awe over how much the snake could bulge out and
      remain unbothered, how a meal no matter how heavy or light can be effortlessly pushed inside. However with your
      rare
      point of view on the grim act you were far from amazed, and wished humans were an exception to the horrific
      process,
      be it too wide to be swallowed, would cause indigestion, the struggles would be too difficult to contain and
      they'd
      get out, or some other reason, however that wasn't the case, and the grim reality was that humans were just like
      every other animal to a snake.<br><br>

      In hindsight you cursed your morning self, incredibly naive, believing there'd be no real danger, thinking you
      were
      above all animals of the jungle. Kaa had seen to it to remind you of your place on the food chain, and you
      certainly
      existed on it. You begged once more for the Indian pythons mercy<br><br>

      The only response you got was a sinister chuckle, proving how fatal your adventure would turn out to be.<br><br>

      The tight slimy band which easily expanded over your shoulders had no problem accepting your feet, they eagerly
      pushed firmed into them as they passed over before finally a wet suction sound rang out as it closed tightly
      behind,
      you had at last been swallowed successfully by the great Indian python named Kaa. The slippery folds massaged your

      Your face streaked in his saliva and your own tears, unable to free yourself, but unable to accept your fate, you
      lay in the folded mass, fear made you unable to think properly, though trapped inside a snake what could you
      possibly think of to save yourself. Your body continued towards the terminus.<br><br>

      The branch, which had been a favourite of Kaas, had finally taken too much of his immeasurable weight over the
      years
      as it finally snapped. Kaa cried out in surprise, as the both of you fell back to the ground, he was out cold the
      second he landed on the jungle floor, the impact caused you to be spat out, helped by his saliva which acted like
      a
      top grade lubricant.<br><br>

      The swirling mass of colours grew fainter as the fog in your mind slowly began to clear, you breathed out heavily
      as
      a dizziness engulfed you, your brain felt like it was spinning constantly, like some strange hangover. You slowly
      began to perceive a heavy mass laying on you as your eyes suddenly shot open wide in realisation. You looked down
      and saw nothing but a bulky length of browns and blacks resting on you. Turning your head in a panic you saw the
      snake out cold, a thick branch and numerous large splinters littered the floor around you both. Finally piecing
      together what must have happened you hastily pushed the coils off of you. The soft spongy mass moved with some
      considerable effort as your breaths came in short rapid bursts, clearly fueled by adrenaline as you raced to
      escape
      not wanting to stick around and find out if he was knocked out or killed by the high fall.<br><br>

      Finally you managed to pull your feet free from the coils and wasting no time you hastily grabbed your clothes and
      ran back towards the hotel. No longer taking your thought to be a boring life for granted. No longer yearning for
      an
      adventure. No longer being naive to peoples warnings over the potential dangers that may lurk in the jungle. In
      all
      the years of Kaas life, you had been the first to ever escape from his clutches.<br><br>

      As his own mind fog dissipated Kaa regained consciousness, his head throbbing with pain. He groaned out in
      discomfort as a thick portion of his body rubbed over the top of his head in a soothing manner. His body felt
      lighter, less sluggish as his stomach began groaning once again, realising he must have accidentally spat you out
      he
      began to address you "Well" he started as the pain began to ease "I mussst apologissse for my carelesssnesss … but
      have no fear Kaa here will put you back in your placcce my delectiable sssnack" he chuckled smugly as he turned
      his
      head towards the mass of coils. "WHAT!" he shouted in shock, quickly moving his coils around to make sure you
      weren't fully covered, noticing the hypnosis must have worn off and you had managed to escape his tail wrapped
      around the thickest part of the broken branch and crushed it with relative ease "Oh why did you fail to sssupport
      me
      and that tasssty little sssnack hmm" he spoke with disappointment, knowing you'd be well on your way to the
      village.<br><br>

      A slight grin appeared across his face as he tossed the broken branches away. "Hmm maybe thisss can work in my
      favour... “Yesss. Sssurely they will warn the othersss about me, and they will have to return to ssshow them where

      You slowly opened your eyes, light flooding your vision, as they began adjusting to the brightness, you breathed

      heavily as the crushing pressing you couldn't get used to had alleviated. The thick mass was still lain on you,

      Taking his time as he did with all his food the sun continued to move across the sky. Kaa moved down more and
      closed
      his mouth firmly across your stomach, shivering in delight at your wriggles as each touch the folds lay on you set
      intense fireworks off internally. He wriggled the upper jaw side to side to ensure he had a good grip of you
      before
      clamping down firmly, expelling another forceful cough from further within the ever expanding prison of muscles
      and
      scales, his body creaked loudly like rubber being stretched as his body swelled, clearly showing a human shape
      bulge
      being pulled deeper inside the digestive tract of a massive Indian python. The scales contorted around your face,
      displaying an expression of pure exhilaration.<br><br>

      Deafening gurgles groaned out within as his stomach was getting more and more impatient for you, the thick folds
      which moulded perfectly to your features vibrated in response before once again resuming its usual motion, rubbing
      softly yet firmly across every inch of your body inside, effortlessly beckoning you in further, an act which you
      showed no resistance to. Kaa's muffled laugh escaped his maw as he could tell just how much you enjoyed the peril
      you were in.<br><br>

      Still unable to stop drooling over your taste he hissed in excitement, knowing he still had half of your body left
      to consume, a daunting task, however the snake was very experienced in dealing with humans of all shape and sizes,
      no meal was too much for him to handle, and like all the others you were not giving him any issues, much to both
      of
      your liking.<br><br>

      Another longing squeeze applied to your legs and lower arms as Kaa prepared to open wide once more and move
      further
      down you, you gasped involuntarily at the sudden constriction, but still you didn't cry out in terror or anger,

      After a few brief moments the folds over your face begin to make it hard to breathe, instinctively you move your
      face for air, but the internal muscles refuse to allow that as they continue to smother all that was swallowed up.
      Paired with the intense squeezes from the muscles that forced more air out of you a moment of realisation finally
      came over you. Like waking from a strange dream you began to ask yourself what you were doing, why you were giving
      your life up for this, the reality of the encounter was turning into a nightmare.<br><br>

      You gasped softly, as you tried in vain to resume enjoying yourself again, after all this is what you always
      dreamed
      of, you even ventured into the jungles hoping to find him without giving much of a second thought, and now part of
      you wished to bail out. The regret and fear in your mind only continued to build in severity as your hearing was
      forced to acknowledge the gurgling and groaning from Kaa's digestive tract.<br><br>

      You spread your arms and legs out, as your survival instinct at long last kicked in, no longer wanting to be a
      meal,
      the long sought after fantasy should have remained just as that as you would like all the others end up in the
      belly
      of the snake. You thrashed around wildly as best you could. "LET ME OUT!" You screamed in protest, horrified over
      your predicament "PLEASE!" you begged. Kaa only emitted a mumble of a laugh,the prison around you shook rather
      violently as a result. Kaa couldn't care less if you were having second thoughts, as he was a creature without
      mercy.<br><br>

      Kaa watched intently, grinning wickedly, as your body finally travelled further down the deadly tube enough that
      you’d never be able to be brought back up, not that Kaa had any desire to. His innards never once stopped their
      exploration of you, as they beckoned you to his belly. The thick drool plastered onto your face like the grin you
      had, still in utter bliss, joy filled your heart as the staggering pleasure kept you complicit in your role of

      a feast for Kaa, and like with every other person he had swallowed up, you had not escaped him. "Don't worry,

      his internal muscle washing over you, brough you one push closer to your deadly digestion.<br><br>

      Another tight ring pushed against your head before expanding and gliding smoothly over you, the new area was more
      roomier and didn't smother you with folds, a strange bubbling and gurgling sound was made as you were
      unceremoniously dumped into his stomach. The flesh like the entrance to the throat closed off firmly behind the
      soles of your feet.<br><br>

      The smug Indian python continued to grin widely as he closed his eyes and rested his head on the branch, his
      stomach
      churning as you sloshed around inside, like him your grin not once falling.<br><br>

      It would take many days for your body to truly vanish and for you to become a part of the creature that claimed
      you
      for its own. The hotel staff was unsure what happened, no police could find you, no search party was successful,
      and
      your work was puzzled as to what happened on your trip.<br><br>

      The only creature alive who knew where you vanished to, would assure a fellow explorer of your disappearance, but
      not before ensnaring them and sending them on their way to their demise just as he had done with you.<br><br>

      A thick hazy fog slowly cleared, the colour in your eyes dulled as the swirls shrunk, the smile on your face
      slowly
      dropped as your cheeks began to sense how tired they were from the wide grinning. You gasped softly, your mind
      slowly waking up from a strange groggy state. "What happened?" you wonder as you begin to move your hand and rub
      your eyes. Your arms unable to budge, they were stuck firmly to your sides. Your mind slowly started to become
      more
      sober as your senses started to kick in, your vision dark, your sense of touch was wet and your muscles ached,
      your
      sense of smell assaulted by a rather noxious odour, your hearing fored to awknowldge a strange gurgling and
      groaning.<br><br>

      You spread your arms and legs out, noticing you were in some strange slippery mass that expanded but refused to
      burst. Exhausted you relented and the walls bounced back, slapping firmly against your bare skin. Disoriented you
      recalled the events before the gap in your memory. You recalled the morning in the hotel, the warnings of the shop
      merchant, and being intrigued by a sense of adventure, meeting a talking snake and ... Finally within the dark
      chamber a lightbulb went off. The disappearances weren't a tall tale, it was very real, and you were now one of
      them, as you too ended up in the belly of the snake. You thrashed around wildly against the elasticated flesh.
      "LET
      ME OUT!" You screamed in protest, horrified over your predicament "PLEASE!" you begged.<br><br>

      From outside the weak muffled moans of protest could be faintly heard as Kaa perked up, he opened his eyes and
      lifted his head, shuddering in pleasure over the sudden sensation of your stringent efforts of escape "Ohh" he
      shivered "I do love it when a meal wrigglesss in my belly" he chuckled "Not many manage to sssnap out of it in
      time
      you know, they jussst remain motionlessss. I'm ssso glad you're not one of them, ssso pleassse put up a fight" he
      smugly laughs finding each and every movement you made inside of him exhilirating, as you struggle over the
      churning
      guts "PLEASE!" you beg once again, your best efforts seemingly useless to even hurt the snake. "Sssorry, onccce a
      meal crossssssesss pathsss with me they can never leave" he chuckles "and you ... are no exccception"<br><br>

      Trapped in a dark chamber that was going to digest you, you couldn't tell how much time had passed, an hour? more?
      a
      day? several? time was meaningless inside the powerful snake, and your struggles eventually weakened. You spent
      the
      last of your efforts and went limp, your body no longer able to move, only twitch faintly in the fluids which
      bathed
      you, a tingling sensation while not yet painful, but irritating, accompanied the deadly bath.<br><br>

      Like all the rest you would become a part of Kaa. The energy you'd provide him and the length you'd add to him
      would
      help him in capturing his next unlucky victim. Just as the one prior had been used to capture you. Since you could
      no longer struggle, Kaa's fun with you was over, he lowered his head onto the branch, once more he yawned widely,
      and smacked his lips relishing in your taste one last time before closing his eyes and drifting off to sleep. The
      air surrounding him carried the sound of his gurgling gut as it got to work on you.<br><br>

      ENDING E<br><br>

    <div id="110" class="section">

      Your vision was dark, your sense of feel was wet and muscles ached, your sense of smell assaulted by a rather
      noxious odour, your hearing forced to acknowledge the gurgling and groaning from deeper within. Your best efforts
      were easily thwarted by Kaa whos innards remained unaffected by even your most strident of struggles, if it was
      under different circumstances you'd be in awe over how much the snake could bulge out and remain unbothered, how a
      meal no matter how heavy or light can be effortlessly pushed inside. However with your rare point of view on the
      grim act you were far from amazed, and wished humans were an exception to the horrific process, be it too wide to
      be
      swallowed, would cause indigestion, the struggles would be too difficult to contain and they'd get out, or some
      other reason, however that wasn't the case, and the grim reality was that humans were just like every other animal
      to a snake.<br><br>

      You spread your arms and legs out, against the slippery mass that expanded but refused to burst, confirming a
      human's fate against a snake was the same as any other animal it feasted on. Exhausted you relented and the walls
      bounced back, slapping firmly into you once more. You recalled the warnings of the shop merchant, and being
      intrigued by a sense of adventure, in hindsight you cursed your morning self, incredibly naive, believing there'd
      be
      no real danger, thinking you were above all animals of the jungle. Kaa had seen to it to remind you of your place
      on
      the food chain, and you certainly existed on it. The disappearances weren't a tall tale, it was very real, and you
      were now one of them, as you too ended up in the belly of the snake. "LET ME OUT!" You screamed in protest
      tearfully
      "PLEASE!" you begged hoping Kaa would eventually take pity on you.<br><br>

      The only response you got was a sinister chuckle, proving how fatal your adventure would turn out to be. Trapped
      in
      a dark chamber that was going to digest you, you couldn't tell how much time had passed, an hour? more? a day?
      several? Time was meaningless inside the powerful snake, and your struggles were no more, as your limp body was no
      longer able to move, only twitch faintly in the fluids which bathed you, a tingling sensation while not yet
      painful,
      but was irritating accompanied the deadly bath.<br><br>

      Like all the rest you would become a part of Kaa the energy you'd provide him and the length you'd add to him

      The warm sticky substance runs down your legs, Kaa never once being put off by your flavour a strong breeze blows
      between them as the immeasurable python hissed softly, earning a shudder from within. His tongue randomly licking
      your arms, the shuddering turned into frantic movements as your sensitive skin found the slick tongue to be the
      most
      ticklish sensation you’ve ever felt before. Held firmly by the coils, and his thorat, you were unable to make Kaa
      cease his tongue's playful exploration of you, clearly he was enjoying the teasing, much to your begging for him
      to
      stop. You howled with laughter as Kaa giggled at your intense reaction, he stopped the tasting after a few brief
      moments and the folds went still, allowing you to regain your breath, you lay there panting for air, calming
      yourself down, a short reprieve as the folds started shifting around you once again as you sunk deeper into the
      snakes unforgiving gut.<br><br>

      Slowly your butt lifted off of the branch, no longer being supported as the tight band glided smoothly along your
      legs, your body coiled less and less. Kaa now no longer needed to move down to further swallow you, enough of your
      body was swallowed up that his folds would pull you in further to your imminent demise.<br><br>

      A involutariy gasp was released as his mouth accepted your sex, the pressure around the senstivie area made you
      writhe faintly, Kaa responded as the folds clenched around you as tight as his coils did, he knew you wren't
      trying
      to fight back, and were instead thrilled at the sensation on a paticular area.<br><br>

      A few seconds passed as you moaned lustfully, he chuckled slightly as he once again relaxed and resumed, the band
      snapped below your knees, your hands now joined the many moist folds. Fingers slipped in between them as they
      greedily trapped them in the pulsing mass of flesh. Kaas maw lifted once again as he forced you inside a few more
      inches before clamping down once again around your calves, your feet twitched and kicked in response to the
      stimulation inside as Kaas advanced.<br><br>

      The final coil around your ankle released you as Kaa prepared to swallow again, knowing his meal was almost over
      in
      the next swallow or two, he shuddered occasionally at the feeling of your movements, chuckling to himself as you
      were a very rare meal, the likes of which which he doubt he'd ever meet again, you belonged to him, and he was
      going
      to make good use of your life just as he had done with all those who came before you.<br><br>

      After a few brief moments the folds over your face begin to make it hard to breathe, instinctively you move your
      face for air, but the internal muscles refuse to allow that as they continue to smother all that was swallowed up.
      Paired with the intense squeezes from the muscles that forced more air out of you a moment of realisation finally
      came over you. Like waking from a strange dream you began to ask yourself what you were doing, why you were giving
      your life up for this, the reality of the encounter was turning into a nightmare.<br><br>

      You gasped softly, as you tried in vain to resume enjoying yourself again, after all this is what you always
      dreamed
      of, you even ventured into the jungles hoping to find him without giving much of a second thought, and now part of
      you wished to bail out. The regret and fear in your mind only continued to build in severity as your hearing was
      forced to acknowledge the gurgling and groaning from Kaa's digestive tract.<br><br>

      You spread your arms and legs out, as your survival instinct at long last kicked in, no longer wanting to be a
      meal,
      the long sought after fantasy should have remained just as that as you would like all the others end up in the
      belly
      of the snake. You thrashed around wildly as best you could. "LET ME OUT!" You screamed in protest, horrified over
      your predicament "PLEASE!" you begged. Kaa only emitted a mumble of a laugh,the prison around you shook rather
      violently as a result. Kaa couldn't care less if you were having second thoughts, as he was a creature without
      mercy.<br><br>

      no

      your memory. You recalled the events of the morning, looking over the balcony, peering at the jungle, nervous
      butterflies in your stomach as you secretly wished to meet ... Kaa.<br><br>

      The branch had finally reached its limit supporting Kaa and all the meals who added to his mass, as a loud
      cracking
      sound echoed, and before Kaa could re-adjust the two of you, it snapped. Kaa's eyes went wide in shock as you both
      plummeted to the ground. The impact immediately knocked him out as the collision was enough to force you out of
      him,
      helped by his saliva which acted like a top grade lubricant.<br><br>

      You gasped as the coils you fell back into loosened around you, the breeze washed over your face, however you
      found
      it odd that there was no hiss to accompany it, further finding it strange why his mouth wasn't moving further down
      you, afterall his coils loosened to swallow more of you. "Kaa" you called out in a shaky voice, as you opened your
      eyes. You look up into the treetops that appeared high above, instantly you noticed you were on the jungle floor,
      you frantically looked around and saw piles of branches littering the surrounding area, and Kaa nearby out cold.
      Figuring out what happened you wasted no time in squandering the luck you were granted as you pushed his coils
      away
      hastily, you hoped good fortune remained on your side and that the Indian python wouldn't regain consciousness, as
      you knew he'd pick up where he left off, with one final push of his incredibly heavy mass you finally freed
      yourself
      from his clutches.<br><br>

      With your heart racing you quickly grabbed your clothes not sticking around to tempt fate further, you ran back to
      the hotel dripping from Kaa's slime. In all the years of Kaas life, not only were you the first to be willing,
      albeit have second thoughts, you had also been the first to ever escape from his clutches.<br><br>

      A low groan escaped Kaa's scaly lips as he regained consciousness, his head throbbed with pain, his eyes adjusted
      to
      the light as a thick portion of his body rubbed over the top of his head in a soothing manner "Well" he started as
      the pain began to ease "I mussst apologissse for my carelesssnesss, ssshall we continue my deliccciousss sssnack
      hmm?" he asked smugly, the pain no longer bothering him, with a smile Kaa turned his head towards the mass of
      coils.
      "WHAT!" he shouted in shock, quickly moving his coils around to make sure you weren't fully covered, noticing you
      had managed to escape his tail wrapped around the thickest part of the broken branch and crushed it with relative
      ease "Oh why did you fail to sssupport me and that tasssty little sssnack hmm, they were ssso delisssiousss" he
      spoke with disappointment.<br><br>

      Knowing you began to regret being swallowed he doubted you would return to him. He frowned in disappointment as he
      tossed the broken branch pieces away. "Thisss isss not fair, they sssought me out, and I held up my end of the
      deal,
      and yet they ran" His tail swiped at the dirt in dismay, his stomach rumbled loudly as the tip of his body rubbed
      and patted it in a calming manner, your scent indicated you were long gone and Kaa wouldn't be able to catch up
      with
      you. The Indian python hoped the strong desire would one day return, and you'd willingly seek him out again, and
      if
      you ever did he would make sure you’d regret the day you were ever born.<br><br>

      received no response from you. Your mind blissfully numb as it swam in an infinite ocean of euphoria, it felt like
      everything was right, that you were safe, that you'd never have a single worry ever again as you sunk deeper into
      the snake's unforgiving gut. You have finally found your place in the world.<br><br>

      Slowly your butt lifted off of the branch, no longer being supported as the tight band glided smoothly along your

      The soft cushiony mouth pressed firmly into your ankles you couldn't help but grin as Kaa hissed loudly, clearly
      enjoying his meal, your heart fluttered knowing that he appreciated you in a way no one else ever could. The
      adrenaline kicked into overdrive as he was so close to fully consuming you, the folds clamped down firmly and
      shook
      violently as Kaa once again laughed at your eagerness to slip further inside, still refusing to fight back, both
      knowing he was never going to let you go anyway even if you did. Your eyes gently folded as you listened to the
      creaking sound of his folds pushing against your ears, the occasional soft squelching as they explored your naked
      body, you whispered your gratitude to him as you pressed your lips against the slippery folds and gave them a
      tender
      kiss. The groans from within getting louder as you were aware how closer you were getting to the belly of the
      powerful Kaa with each gulp, it grew more impatient for nourishment, but the python was patient and had as always
      ignored the urge to swallow you up quickly, and instead chose to endure his body's complaints to hurry up, in
      exchange for savouring his rare meals, and in your case, of willingly seeking him out, an exceptionally rare treat
      for him, one the both of you enjoyed prolonging longer than usual.<br><br>

      Kaa gently lowered both of you onto the branch, now laying across it, the jungle air flowed in between your toes,
      they wriggled violently as his tongue teasingly tickled your soles, you howled in laughter once again, thrashing
      around in a desperate bid to escape his playful tongue that once again explored your sensitive flesh, the thick
      drool ran down your feet as his warm breath washed over them. After a few moments his tongue retreated and you
      breathed heavily, Kaa once again gracious enough to allow you a reprieve to recover from your recent laughing
      fit.<br><br>

      A powerful puff of air from Kaa brushed over your feet again as his mouth opened to finally finish the job and
      seal
      you away for good. He hissed, saliva spraying out in thick strands as he slowly moved his head forward. His mouth
      pushed into your soles as it closed around them securely. He closed his eyes gently and moved his head up to the
      sky, your feet slipped to the back of his mouth, a smug sneer covered your face, it was the moment you had long
      waited for, the ring of muscle started to accept the last of you, still offering no struggles, which at that point
      would have been utterly useless as there was nothing to stop you from slipping further down the bowles of the
      beast.
      His belly vibrated wildly, as you drew closer towards it.<br><br>

      Tears
      began to well up and fall silently down your face, mixing with his saliva, you whispered in a shaky voice,
      pleading
      for his mercy. Your feet being the only thing left to consume twitched and kicked still showing what little signs
      of
      protest you could. The groans from within grew louder as you were forced to acknowledge how closer you were
      getting
      to the belly of the powerful Kaa. It became more impatient for nourishment as the horrific act had been
      intentionally prolonged, but the python was patient and had as always ignored the urge to swallow you up quickly,
      and instead chose to endure his body's complaints to hurry up, in exchange for savouring his rare meals, and in
      your
      case, of waking up early, was exceptionally a rare treat for him, and one he enjoyed prolonging longer than
      usual.<br><br>

      Kaa gently lowered both of you onto the branch, now laying across it, the jungle air flowed in between your toes,
      which wriggled in vain as his tongue playfully tickled your soles. You howled in laughter despite the situation
      being far from funny, thrashing around in a desperate bid to escape his playful tongue as it once again explored
      your sensitive flesh. The thick drool ran down your feet as your tears of horror turned into tears of laughter,
      the
      ticklish sensation was more intense than your arms had received. After a few moments his tongue retreated and you
      breathed heavily after your laughing fit.<br><br>

      The powerful breath of Kaa washed over your feet again as his mouth opened to finally finish the job and seal you
      away for good, he hissed, saliva spraying out in thick strands as he slowly moved his head forward. The mouth
      pushed
      into your soles as it closed around them securely. He closed his eyes gently and moved his head up to the sky,
      your
      feet slipped to the back of his mouth, and the ring of muscle started to accept the last of you.<br><br>

      Struggling was useless, begging only amused Kaa, there was nothing to stop you from slipping further down the
      bowles
      of the beast. His belly vibrated wildly, demanding your company.<br><br>

      His grumbles?<br><br>Finally snap the branch - <a class="choice" value="115">Continue</a><br><br>Are answered.

      The soft cushiony mouth pressed firmly into your ankles, your unmoving feet being the only thing left to consume.
      The groans from within were getting louder as you were completely unaware how closer you were getting to the belly
      of the powerful Kaa. It grew more impatient for nourishment, but the python was patient and had as always ignored
      the urge to swallow you up quickly, and instead chose to endure his body's complaints to hurry up, in exchange for
      savouring his rare meals.<br><br>

      Kaa gently lowered both of you onto the branch, now laying across it, the jungle air flowed in between your toes,
      unmoving as his tongue playfully tickled your soles. The spell he placed you under still holding up firm as you
      remained unaffected by any sensation, incapable of any thought, only a warm fuzzy feeling coarsed through you,
      like
      a warm weighted blanket, a sensation like the first few moments in the morning when you wake up without any
      thought,
      without any memory, just complete relaxation and content with the world.<br><br>

      The powerful breath of Kaa washed over your feet as his mouth opened to finally finish the job and seal you away

      A thick hazy fog slowly cleared, the colour in your eyes dulled and shrunk, the smile on your face slowly dropped
      as
      your cheeks began to sense how tired they were. You gasped softly, your mind slowly waking up from a strange
      groggy
      state. "What happened?" you wonder as you began to move your hand and rub your eyes, unable to. Your mind slowly
      started to become more sober as your senses started to kick in, your vision dark, your sense of touch was wet and
      your muscles ached, your sense of smell assaulted by a rather unpleasant odour, your hearing fored to awknowldge a
      strange gurgling and groaning.<br><br>

      You spread your arms and legs out, noticing you were unable to. Not being able to put up much of a struggle at the
      moment, the strange hypnotic experience still exhausted you. Disoriented you recalled the events before the gap in
      your memory. You recalled the events of the morning, looking over the balcony, peering at the jungle, nervous
      butterflies in your stomach as you secretly wished to meet ... Kaa.<br><br>

      Finally within the darkness a lightbulb went off. A smile faintly appeared on your face once again, thrilled to
      have
      been a victim of Kaa.<br><br>

      The tight slimy band which easily expanded over your shoulders had no problem accepting your feet, they eagerly
      pushed firmed into them as they passed over before finally a wet suction sound rang out as it closed tightly
      behind,
      you had at last been swallowed successfully by the mighty python named Kaa. Your long sought after fantasy is
      finally fulfilled. The slippery folds massage your entire body as it pushes firmly into you again and again from
      all
      sides, effortlessly guiding you to his impatient belly. Your face streaked in his saliva, a thrilling sensation
      that
      only added to the intense situation, you lay in the folded mass complicit, offering no resistance as your body
      continued towards the deadly terminus.<br><br>

      A sigh of bliss escaped Kaa as he laid his head onto the branch to rest for a moment. "One more little meal

      body echoed far and wide while it stretched above your head and contracted tightly at the soles of your feet. The
      scales flowed like thick gelatinous water over your bugle form, moving slowly down the rock python's body to
      become
      a part of his.<br><br>

      Kaa raised his head and looked back over your trapped form, he grinned slyly, admiring his own body making light

      and expanded to make your journey of no return an easy one. Your shaking form which cried out in lust moved
      further

      Kaa continued to watch you intensely as your writing movements were made apparent as his scales glistened in the
      light like precious jewels, your efforts clearly seen as each soft but powerful movement from his digestive tract
      brought wave after wave of exuberance, your gasps of passion earning a chuckle from outside as the Indian python
      was
      able to pick it up "Enjoying yourssself?" he asked smugly, both of you knew the answer, his body creaked loudly as
      it inexorably pulled you further inside. Kaa not once looking away as the huge grin remained on his face, the
      massive snake assured you you'd soon be with all the others, the place where all his unwilling prey ventured to
      and
      meet their end, and now it was your turn.<br><br>

      Not so different from entering his throat a similar sensation of a tight ring of muscle began to expand over the
      crown of your head, the journey of no return was almost at an end. Slowly your face entered the new area, that was
      much roomier and didn't smother you with folds, a strange bubbling and gurgling sound was made as you were
      unceremoniously dumped into his stomach. The flesh like the entrance to the throat closed off tightly behind the
      soles of your feet forever.<br><br>

      Content with another successful feeding, Kaa smacked his lips enjoying your lingering taste as he closed his eyes
      and rested his head on the branch, his stomach churned and you started to slosh around inside, your gasps cried
      out
      as the process was more forceful and intense than you had anticipated.<br><br>

      It would take many days for your body to truly vanish and for you to become a part of the creature that you gave
      yourself up for. The hotel staff were unsure what happened, no police could find you, no search party was
      successful, your work was unsure what happened.<br><br>

      The only creature alive who knew where you vanished to would assure a fellow explorer of your disappearance, but
      not
      before capturing them and sending them on their way to their demise just as he had done with you.<br><br>

      ENDING N<br><br>

    </div>
    <div id="127" class="section">

      With a smug grin plastered on his face Kaa watched intently as his body pushed you inexorably further inside him.
      The deeper the went the more the folds over your face made it harder to breathe. Instinctively you moved your face
      for air, but the internal muscles refused to allow that as they continued to smother all that was swallowed up,
      paired with the intense squeezes from the muscles that forced more air out of you, a moment of realisation finally
      came over you. Like waking from a strange dream you began to ask yourself what you were doing, why you were giving
      your life up for this, the reality of the encounter was turning into a nightmare.<br><br>

      You gasped softly, as you tried in vain to resume enjoying yourself again, after all this is what you always
      dreamed
      of, you even ventured into the jungles hoping to find him without giving much of a second thought, and now part of
      you wished to bail out. The regret and fear in your mind only continued to build in severity as your hearing was
      forced to acknowledge the gurgling and groaning from Kaa's internal body, a body you knew would become your
      tomb.<br><br>

      You spread your arms and legs out, as your survival instinct at long last kicked in, no longer wanting to be a
      meal,
      the long sought after fantasy should have remained just as that as you would like all the others, end up in the
      belly of the snake. You thrashed around wildly as best you could. "LET ME OUT!" You screamed in protest, now
      horrified over your predicament "PLEASE!" you begged. Kaa only emitted a mumble of a laugh,the prison around you
      shook rather violently as a result. “Isssn’t it a bit late to change your mind?” Kaa giggled mockingly, he
      couldn't
      care less if you were having second thoughts, as he was a creature without mercy.<br><br>

      He shuddered in delight with your struggles. The loud creaking of his scales was evidence of how impressive his
      body
      was in keeping its prey captive, you were his and he was never going to let you go. The movements in his throat
      caused small whimpers from within as the stomach's protests grew louder and louder with each little push, a grim
      indiciation of your imminent doom drawing nearer. From outside you could hear the continuous muffled chuckling of
      the snake as he assured you you'd soon be with all the others, the place where all his prey ventured to and meet
      their end, and now it was your turn.<br><br>

      Similar to entering his throat a tight band of muscle seperated you from his stomach, the crown of your head
      pushed
      into it, you screamed in terror as the band of muscle began to open and accept your head, through your screams Kaa
      giggled and wished for you to have fun in there. As the rest of your body began to join your face in the gut you
      noticed how spacious it was compared to the claustrophobic folds that guided the rest of your body in. A new
      unfamiliar bubbling sound began to start as you noticed the stomach began to stir, more of your body sloshed
      around
      inside his churning gut as the tight ring closed off tightly behind the soles of your feet forever.<br><br>

      With his stomach finally getting to work, no longer complaining for you, Kaa smacked his lips enjoying your
      lingering taste as he closed his eyes and rested his head on the branch, content with another successful feeding,
      your gasps cried out as the process was more violent, forceful and intense than you imagined.<br><br>

      It would take many days for your body to truly vanish and for you to become a part of the creature that you were
      initially excited to meet. The hotel staff were unsure what happened, no police could find you, no search party

      Kaa watched intently as your body travelled further down the deadly tube, his innards never once stopping their
      exploration of you, as they beckoned you inside. The thick drool plastered onto your face like the grin you had as
      well, still in utter bliss, joy filled your heart as the staggering pleasure was more than worth your imminent
      demise, and like with every other person he had swallowed up, you had not escaped him. "Don't worry, you'll be
      with
      all the othersss sssoone" he chuckled as he assured you of your impending doom, as each wave of his internal
      muscle
      washed over you, brough you one push closer to your deadly digestion.<br><br>

      didn't smother you with folds, a strange bubbling and gurgling sound was made as you were unceremoniously dumped

      The smug Indian python grinned widely as he closed his eyes and rested his head on the branch, his stomach
      churning

      It would take many days for your body to truly vanish and for you to become a part of the creature that claimed
